# Changelog

All notable changes to tofu-open are documented in this file.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added
- **Daily Optimizer (self-tuning loop).** New `lib/optimizer/` package mines the
  prior day's logs, audit events, and daily reports, asks an LLM for
  optimisation proposals, and either auto-applies whitelisted low-risk
  actions (currently `block_search_domain`, with TTL-based auto-revert) or
  stages everything else as `pending_review` for human approval. Runs nightly
  at 03:30 via the scheduler (`Daily Optimizer` task, auto-registered on
  boot). REST API in `routes/optimizer.py`; review UI in `static/js/optimizer.js`.
  Gated by `OPTIMIZER_ENABLED` setting.
- **Skills Store (curated catalogue + drag-and-drop installer).** Settings →
  Skills tab now has an App-Store-style layout (search + Catalogue/Installed
  scope tabs + category pills) backed by `lib/memory/catalog.py`. One-click
  install downloads a `.zip` over HTTPS (≤ 50 MB) and unpacks it via
  `lib/memory/installer.py`. Anthropic / OpenClaw / AgentSkills `.zip`
  packages can also be drag-dropped onto the tab; bundled `install.sh`
  scripts are surfaced as hints, never auto-executed.
- **Pluggable token counter.** New `lib/token_counter/` package routes token
  counting through provider-specific backends (Anthropic / Gemini / DeepSeek
  / HuggingFace / tiktoken / heuristic) with a usage cache, replacing the
  scattered ad-hoc estimators.
- **File-history store.** New `lib/file_history/` records per-file edit
  history so write tools and the diff viewer can show a coherent timeline
  of changes across a session.
- **Memory prefetch.** `lib/memory/prefetch.py` surfaces likely-relevant
  memories at turn start via the `<relevant_memories>` block, so the model
  doesn't have to call `search_memories` as a generic discovery step.
- **Compaction archive viewer.** New `routes/conversations_compaction.py`
  + `static/js/compaction-viewer.js` let you inspect the archived layers
  produced by 3-layer context compaction.
- **Conversation full-text search endpoints** moved into a dedicated
  `routes/conversations_search.py` Blueprint (extracted from
  `routes/conversations.py`).
- **Provider templates.** Added Meituan and Tencent provider one-click
  templates in Settings → Providers.

### Improved
- **`routes/chat.py` decomposition.** Extracted `chat_human_io.py`,
  `chat_queue.py`, and `chat_tool_state.py` so the chat blueprint is
  smaller and individual concerns (stdin/human-guidance responses,
  server-side message queue, tool-toggle PATCH) live in their own
  modules.
- **PDF parsing.** Added `lib/pdf_parser/docling.py` as an additional
  backend alongside the existing text/VLM/math paths.
- **Project tools.** New `lib/project_mod/gitignore_suggest.py` proposes
  `.gitignore` entries for files the indexer keeps re-scanning.
- **Multi-root workspace robustness.** Extra roots now persist across
  conversation switches (frontend sends `projectPaths`; backend
  `ensure_project_state()` accepts `extra_paths`). The system prompt's
  multi-root section explicitly warns about new-file creation in
  non-primary roots, since there is no auto-detection until the file
  exists.
- **`requirements.txt`.** Pin `lxml_html_clean>=0.4` so trafilatura keeps
  working on lxml 5.2+ where `lxml.html.clean` was extracted.

### Fixed
- Numerous small fixes in browser dispatch, conv_ref handling, image
  generation, LLM sanitisation, scheduler timer/manager, and trading
  decision routes (see file-level diffs).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **MCP launcher pre-flight check.** When an MCP server is configured with a
  `command` that is not on PATH (e.g. `uvx` without uv installed, `npx` without
  Node), we now emit a clear, actionable install hint instead of a cryptic
  `FileNotFoundError`. Covers uvx / npx / pipx / node / python3.

### Improved
- **Overleaf MCP auto-install resilience.** The catalog entry and migration
  rules now pin `overleaf-mcp-plus[compile]>=0.1.3`, the slimmer release that
  drops the unused playwright dependency (~100 MB faster first-run install).
- **Auto-migration upgraded.** Stale server entries from prior versions are
  rewritten on load even when only the args list differs — user-supplied env
  vars and credentials are always preserved.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- Fixed Overleaf MCP server failing to launch with `FileNotFoundError: 'overleaf-mcp'`
  on machines where the package was not pre-installed. The curated registry entry
  now uses `uvx --from overleaf-mcp-plus[compile]` so the server is auto-fetched
  from PyPI on first launch, matching the behavior of the other MCP cards.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-20

### Improved
- Further optimized support for Claude Opus 4.7.

### Added
- Added support for the Overleaf MCP server in the curated registry
  (edit/read/compile/history on Overleaf LaTeX projects).

### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect retry behavior of the model when invoked by tools.

## [0.9.0]

- Previous release.
