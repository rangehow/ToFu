"""Endpoint mode — Planner → Worker → Critic autonomous loop.

Three-phase architecture:

  Phase 0 (Planner): Rewrites the user's raw request into a structured
  brief with a checklist and acceptance criteria.  Runs once at the
  start; MAY be re-run mid-task when the Critic emits
  [VERDICT: CONTINUE_PLANNER] to request a full re-plan (e.g. the
  original plan is wrong / out-of-scope).

  Phase 1 (Worker): Full LLM + tools.  Executes the plan.
  Phase 2 (Critic): Full LLM + tools.  Reviews against the checklist.
  Emits one of three verdicts:
    - STOP              → loop terminates.
    - CONTINUE_WORKER   → inject feedback as user msg, loop back to Phase 1.
    - CONTINUE_PLANNER  → feed critic feedback to a fresh Planner turn
                          which produces a NEW brief; worker messages
                          are reset to `[system, user(new brief)]`.

Conversation shape visible to Worker & Critic (LLM working messages):
  system → user(planner brief)  [first worker turn]
  system → user(planner brief) → assistant(worker) → user(critic feedback) → ...  [later turns]
  After a replan: system → user(NEW planner brief)  [worker re-starts clean]

  The planner's output REPLACES the original user message so the worker
  sees a clean, structured plan as its user request.  This avoids the old
  phantom pattern where assistant(planner) + user("Execute…") were appended.

Conversation shape in the DB / frontend (display):
  user(original)
  → assistant(planner, _isEndpointPlanner, _epPlannerIteration=1)
  → assistant(worker, _epIteration=1)
  → user(critic, _isEndpointReview, _epNextPhase='worker'|'planner')
  → assistant(worker, _epIteration=2)
  → (replan →) assistant(planner, _isEndpointPlanner, _epPlannerIteration=2)
  → assistant(worker, _epIteration=3)  ... etc.

Termination guardrails:
  1. Critic verdict — STOP means approved.
  2. Stuck detection — similar worker feedback in 2+ consecutive rounds;
     history resets on replan so two distinct plans don't falsely trigger.
  3. Max iterations — hard cap at MAX_ITERATIONS (default 10).
  4. Max replans — hard cap at MAX_REPLANS (default 3) to prevent
     planner ping-pong.
  5. Kill switch — ``CHATUI_ENDPOINT_REPLAN=0`` downgrades
     CONTINUE_PLANNER to CONTINUE_WORKER at the parser layer.
  6. Abort — user can abort at any time.

def _trigger_endpoint_auto_translate(task, endpoint_turns):
    """Trigger server-side auto-translation for every assistant turn in an
    endpoint run.

    The single-turn safety net (``_maybe_auto_translate_assistant``) is
    normally invoked from ``_sync_result_to_conversation``, but
    ``persist_task_result`` deliberately skips that path for endpoint tasks
    (the multi-turn sync is done by ``_sync_endpoint_turns_to_conversation``
    instead).  Without this helper, NO endpoint turn — not the planner, not
    any worker iteration — would ever be auto-translated, even when the
    conversation has ``settings.autoTranslate`` ON.

    This helper re-reads the full persisted message list from the DB so it
    can compute the correct ``msg_idx`` for each assistant turn, then calls
    the existing safety-net function once per assistant turn.  The
    safety-net itself handles:
      - per-conversation ``settings.autoTranslate`` gate,
      - already-translated dedup,
      - running frontend-task dedup against ``_translate_tasks``,
      - stale-partial-translation detection,
      - background thread spawning.

    Critic review messages (``role == 'user'``, ``_isEndpointReview``) are
    also translated via ``_maybe_auto_translate_critic`` — same safety-net
    logic, same autoTranslate gate, just annotated with a ``Critic`` log
    prefix for observability.  The critic bubble displays the translation
    via the frontend's updated ``renderMessage`` critic branch.

    Parameters
    ----------
    task : dict
        The endpoint task dict (needs ``convId`` and ``id``).
    endpoint_turns : list
        The final list of endpoint turn messages synced to the DB.
