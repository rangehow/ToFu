 * The two rules that make INTERACTIVE_SSO actually work, as pure functions.

 * Both existed only as intentions before: the login path RETURNED
 * [LoginResult.NeedsInteractiveSso] and the card copy told the user to "tap
 * Open, sign in once", but nothing navigated into the WebView and nothing ever
 * stamped `cookieHost` afterwards. So SSO was a closed loop — Open did nothing
 * visible, and Start/Stop stayed unavailable forever.
 *
 * They live here, off Android, because the previous three staleness-guard bugs
 * all shared one shape: the RULE was fine, the values wired into it were not.
 * A named pure function lets a test assert the inputs.
