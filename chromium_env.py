"""chromium_env.py — single source of truth for the headless-Chromium runtime env.

Playwright's Chromium is a CHILD process. It resolves its GUI shared libs
(``libatk-1.0.so.0``, ``libnss3.so``, ``libgbm.so.1``, …) through the dynamic
linker, which knows nothing about ``sys.prefix``; and it resolves fonts through
fontconfig, which finds ZERO fonts when ``/etc/fonts`` is absent. So a rootless
install (the conda-forge recipe: GUI libs + fontconfig + a font family inside
the env prefix) needs two environment variables exported before launch:

  * ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``  → or the binary dies instantly with
    "libatk-1.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file".
  * ``FONTCONFIG_PATH`` / ``FONTCONFIG_FILE`` → or it launches and paints CSS
    fine but draws every glyph as nothing, so screenshots come back
    blank-but-styled. That reads as "the page didn't load" rather than as an
    error, which is why it went unnoticed for so long.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (the reuse rule)
---------------------------------------
This logic was hand-copied into four places that each keyed off a DIFFERENT,
weaker signal, so each covered a different subset of entry points:

  ``server.py`` / ``bootstrap.py``  keyed off ``.tofu_env.json`` — a gitignored,
      per-host marker that is deliberately stripped from every export. No
      marker (fresh clone, exported bundle, Docker, ``pip install`` layout)
      → zero exports → dead browser.
  ``tests/conftest.py``             keyed off ``$CONDA_PREFIX`` — unset in any
      shell that did not run ``conda activate``, and never set at all on the
      uv/venv install path.
  ``tofu_search``'s pool            also keyed off ``$CONDA_PREFIX`` (measured
      2026-07-28: with it unset, its self-heal is a no-op and launch fails).

``sys.prefix`` is the one signal that is ALWAYS correct — it is a property of
the running interpreter, not of the shell that happened to launch it, and it is
right for conda envs, uv venvs and plain virtualenvs alike. So resolution
starts there.

The other half of the rule: a candidate directory is accepted only when it
actually CONTAINS one of the libs Chromium needs (:data:`_SENTINEL_LIBS`).
We never infer "this looks like a conda env, so its lib/ must be usable" —
that inference is what let the four copies disagree.

Import discipline (WHY THIS IS AT THE REPO ROOT, not in lib/)
-------------------------------------------------------------
Stdlib-only, and it must stay that way. Two hard constraints, both measured
rather than assumed:

  * ``server.py`` calls this BEFORE any third-party import.
  * ``bootstrap.py``'s entire job is to run when dependencies are MISSING and
    install them, so it cannot import anything that needs them.

A first draft lived at ``lib/chromium_env.py``; the guard in
``tests/test_chromium_env.py`` caught that merely importing it executed
``lib/__init__.py``, which drags in ``requests`` (405 modules, 0.44 s) and
touches the database — fatal for both callers above. Hence the root placement,
next to the other pre-dependency modules. :func:`_log` resolves the logger
lazily for the same reason: runtime diagnostics still reach the normal log
files, but the import graph stays clean.
