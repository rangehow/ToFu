# Tofu Desktop Builds

Standalone installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux — no Python, no conda, no terminal needed.

## Quick Build (local)

```bash
# 1. Install build dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r desktop/requirements-desktop.txt

# 2. Generate platform icons
python scripts/gen_desktop_icons.py

# 3. Build
pyinstaller tofu.spec

# Output: dist/Tofu/
# Run:    dist/Tofu/Tofu        (Linux/macOS)
#         dist/Tofu/Tofu.exe    (Windows)
```

## What's included

The installer bundles:
- Python 3.12 runtime
- Flask + all backend dependencies
- PostgreSQL support (psycopg2 driver — PG server bootstraps on first launch)
- SQLite as automatic fallback when PG is unavailable
- Playwright Python package (browser binary downloaded separately)
- Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS — no build step)
- System tray icon with Open/Quit/Install Components controls
- Auto-opens browser on startup

## First-Launch Experience

The **installer only ships files and launches the app** — it never shells out to
download components (a PyInstaller `--onedir` bundle has no standalone
`python.exe`, so the old installer `[Run]` step that called
`_internal\python.exe -m playwright install` was dead code that also silently
downloaded nothing). Instead, on first launch the **app itself** shows a dialog
asking which optional components to download.

The dialog is the branded **component manager** (`desktop/post_install.py` on
`desktop/_tk_theme.py`): it follows the OS light/dark mode, speaks English or
Chinese by OS locale (`TOFU_THEME` / `TOFU_LANG` override), and — critically —
**stays open during installation with a live per-component status row and an
overall progress bar**. (The original flow closed the window and downloaded
~165 MB invisibly on a background thread; failures were only written to a log
file.) Success and failure messages are shown in the window, and the same
manager is reachable later from the tray menu. The Windows Inno wizard and the
macOS DMG window are branded as well (`scripts/gen_desktop_icons.py` emits the
wizard bitmaps and the DMG window art alongside the icons).

| Component | Size | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PostgreSQL Database** | ~50 MB | ✅ Recommended | Auto-bootstraps a local PG instance for full concurrency + JSONB + FTS |
| **Browser Engine (Chromium)** | ~150 MB | ✅ Recommended | Enables JS-rendered page fetching and browser automation |

When frozen, the Chromium download relaunches `Tofu.exe` with
`TOFU_PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALL=1` (handled in `desktop/launcher.py`), which drives the
bundled `playwright` package in-process — the correct way to reach the
interpreter inside a onedir bundle.

Users can skip and install later via the tray menu: **Right-click → Install Components...**

If both are skipped, the app still works — it uses SQLite for storage and skips browser-dependent features.

## Install location & writable data

The Windows installer installs **per-user** to
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Tofu` (`PrivilegesRequired=lowest`, no UAC/admin
prompt). This matters: the app keeps its `data/` (config, SQLite DB, PostgreSQL
data dir) and `logs/` **next to the executable**, so the install dir must be
user-writable. A `Program Files` install under `lowest` privileges is NOT
writable and used to crash the app on first launch. If the exe dir ever ends up
read-only anyway, the backend falls back to a per-user data dir
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tofu`) — see `lib/runtime_paths.py`.

## Architecture

```
dist/Tofu/
├── Tofu(.exe)        ← Main executable (system tray launcher)
├── _internal/        ← Frozen Python + all packages + app code
│   ├── static/       ← Frontend assets
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── lib/          ← Backend logic (incl. database dual-backend)
│   ├── routes/       ← Flask blueprints
│   └── ...
└── data/             ← User data (created on first run, portable)
    ├── config/       ← Server config, API keys
    ├── pgdata/       ← PostgreSQL data directory (auto-created)
    └── tofu.db       ← SQLite fallback (only if PG unavailable)
```

## Database Strategy

The desktop build uses the same dual-backend architecture as the server deployment:

1. **Primary: PostgreSQL** — auto-bootstrapped as a local userspace process (no admin/sudo needed). The PG server binary is either downloaded on first launch or discovered from the system PATH.
2. **Fallback: SQLite** — if PG bootstrap fails (no binary, no network), the app seamlessly falls back to SQLite. Fully functional for single-user use.

Users never need to think about databases — it Just Works.

## CI / Automated Builds

Push a version tag to trigger builds on all platforms:

```bash
git tag v0.10.0
git push origin v0.10.0
```

This runs `.github/workflows/build-desktop.yml` which produces:
- `Tofu-Setup-<ver>-win64.exe` — Windows installer (Inno Setup)
- `Tofu-<ver>-macos-arm64.dmg` — macOS disk image, Apple Silicon (built on `macos-14`)
- `Tofu-<ver>-macos-x86_64.dmg` — macOS disk image, Intel (built on `macos-13`)
- `Tofu-<ver>-linux-x86_64.deb` — **primary Linux installer** (Debian/Ubuntu):
  installs to `/opt/Tofu` with a system-wide menu entry and icon; user data
  lives in `~/.local/share/Tofu` (the app never writes into `/opt`).
  Install with `sudo apt install ./Tofu-<ver>-linux-x86_64.deb`.
  (Evaluated against AppImage, which lost on three axes: dpkg-deb ships in
  the CI base image — no downloaded tooling; no FUSE at build time; and no
  FUSE at RUN time, whereas type-2 AppImages need `libfuse2`, which
  Ubuntu 22.04+ no longer installs by default.)
- `Tofu-<ver>-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` — Linux portable archive, the no-sudo /
  non-Debian fallback (includes `install.sh` — per-user — which registers an
  application-menu entry and themed icon; run it once after extracting)
- `SHA256SUMS` — checksums covering all of the above

The release is **published immediately and promoted to Latest** (`draft: false` +
`make_latest`), so `…/releases/latest` resolves to it. Two native macOS DMGs are
built (not a universal2 fat binary — the runner interpreter and some C-extension
wheels are single-arch). A completeness gate refuses to publish unless all four
platform/arch assets are present, so a partial build never ships as Latest.

## Manual workflow dispatch

Go to Actions → "Build Desktop" → "Run workflow" to build without tagging.

## Code Signing (optional)

For distribution without OS warnings:
- **Windows**: Get an EV code signing certificate, add to GitHub Secrets as `WIN_CERT_PFX` + `WIN_CERT_PASSWORD`
- **macOS**: Enroll in Apple Developer Program ($99/yr), add `MACOS_CERT_P12` + `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD` + `MACOS_NOTARY_APPLE_ID` / `MACOS_NOTARY_TEAM_ID` / `MACOS_NOTARY_PASSWORD`

The signing steps are already wired into `build-desktop.yml` but **commented out**
(inert) until those secrets exist — uncomment them to enable. Without signing,
users will see SmartScreen (Windows) or Gatekeeper (macOS) warnings on first launch.

## Adding New Optional Components

1. Create a new `Component` subclass in `desktop/post_install.py`
2. Implement `is_installed()` and `install()` methods
3. Add to `OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS` list
4. Set `recommended = True` if it should be pre-checked in the dialog

## Updating

The desktop build does not self-install updates, but on startup it does a
best-effort check of the latest published release: when a newer version exists it
shows a **Download update (&lt;tag&gt;)** item in the system-tray menu that opens the
Releases page. The check runs on a daemon thread, is non-blocking, and fails
silently when offline or rate-limited (see `_check_for_update` in
`desktop/launcher.py`). Users then download and run the new installer — on macOS,
pick the `.dmg` matching their chip (`-arm64` = Apple Silicon, `-x86_64` = Intel).

Future: integrate [Sparkle](https://sparkle-project.org/) (macOS) or [winsparkle](https://winsparkle.org/) (Windows) for in-place delta updates.
