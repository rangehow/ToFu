# Tool inventory (GENERATED — do not edit)

Regenerate with `python3 scripts/gen_tool_inventory.py`; CI pins it
via `tests/test_tool_inventory_generated.py --check`.

One row per BUILT-IN tool. Every column is derived from the live
registry + the per-facet tables — nothing here is hand-maintained.
Third-party plugin tools vary per deployment and are listed in the
diagnostic section at the end, which `--check` ignores.

Built-in tools: **89**

## Gaps

| gap | count | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| write tool with no approval enricher | 0 | the approval dialog renders a bare tool name — the user approves blind, which the approval module itself calls "worse than not prompting at all" |
| no UI label | 75 | the raw tool name is shown in the activity line |
| no reachable handler | 0 | schema advertised to the model but nothing executes it |
| description cannot disambiguate | 6 | the model cannot tell this tool apart from its neighbours and picks the wrong one |
| confusable tool pairs | 3 | two same-category tools open with near-identical sentences, so the model picks the wrong one |

Tools whose description cannot disambiguate:

- `browser_create_tab` — first sentence near-duplicates a same-category sibling
- `browser_navigate` — first sentence near-duplicates a same-category sibling
- `desktop_read_file` — first sentence near-duplicates a same-category sibling
- `desktop_write_file` — first sentence near-duplicates a same-category sibling
- `read_artifact` — first sentence near-duplicates a same-category sibling
- `store_artifact` — first sentence near-duplicates a same-category sibling

Confusable same-category tool pairs (first-sentence overlap >= 0.5):

- [swarm] `read_artifact` vs `store_artifact` — overlap 0.83, shared: artifact, data, read, shared, store
- [browser] `browser_create_tab` vs `browser_navigate` — overlap 0.57, shared: browser, new, tab, url
- [desktop] `desktop_read_file` vs `desktop_write_file` — overlap 0.57, shared: computer, file, local, user
