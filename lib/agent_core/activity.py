"""lib/agent_core/activity.py — Accessor for the project-activity feed seam.

The reusable agent base emits project-brain "Activity Feed" lifecycle pulses
(a turn ``started`` / ``completed`` / ``aborted``) through this seam rather
than importing ``lib.conversations.project_feed`` directly.  This module is
part of the agent base (``lib.agent_core`` is in ``CORE_MODULES``), so it MUST
NOT import ``lib.conversations`` — it only names the *default adapter module*
(:mod:`lib.tasks_pkg.activity_sink`), which is itself non-core and free to bind
the conversations layer.

Mirrors :mod:`lib.agent_core.store` (the ``ConversationStore`` seam) exactly:
a host embedding the agent base against a different — or absent — activity
backend calls :func:`set_activity_sink` once at startup.  When no override is
installed the chatui default (:func:`lib.tasks_pkg.activity_sink.emit_project_activity`)
is lazily bound on first use.  If even that import fails (a standalone
``tofu-agent`` deployment with no conversations layer at all), emission
degrades to a no-op — a missing activity feed must NEVER break a task.
