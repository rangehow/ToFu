"""lib/agent_core/events.py — The streaming event contract, declared.

This module is the **single source of truth** for the event vocabulary that
flows from the agent runtime to any frontend — over the SSE chat stream
(``/api/chat/stream/<id>``, ``/api/v1/tasks/<id>/stream``) and over the unified
push WebSocket (``/api/push``).

Why this exists
---------------
Before this module, the ~40 event ``type`` strings were an *implicit* contract:
defined only by scattered ``append_event(task, {'type': ...})`` call sites in
the orchestrator and the ``ev.type === "..."`` ladders in ``static/js``.  A
third party building their own frontend had to reverse-engineer the stream by
reading our JS.  This registry makes the contract explicit, versioned, and
**machine-discoverable** via ``GET /api/v1/capabilities`` (``events`` block).

What it is / is NOT
-------------------
* It is a *descriptive* registry — a catalogue of every event the runtime can
  emit, each with its category, terminal-ness, a one-line purpose, and the key
  payload fields.
* It is also the *generative* chokepoint: the built-in orchestrator emits via
  :func:`build_event` / :func:`emit` (with :class:`EventType` constants) rather
  than bare-string dict literals, so there is ONE typed event model.
  ``build_event(EventType.PHASE, phase='x')`` is byte-for-byte identical to the
  old ``{'type': 'phase', 'phase': 'x'}`` literal (kwargs preserve order) —
  the conversion changed no wire output, only the construction site.
* It is NOT a validator that rejects unknown events at runtime — the wire stays
  permissive (forward-compatible).  Drift is caught at TEST time by
  ``tests/test_event_registry.py``, which asserts (a) every ``'type':`` string
  emitted in core is registered here, and (b) every type the frontend handles
  is registered.  That is the analog of ``test_core_tool_isolation.py``.

The PHASE sub-vocabulary
------------------------
The ``phase`` event is the stream's *status text* channel ("Retrying…",
"Sent to kimi-k3…", "Compressing context…") — the highest-frequency
human-readable pushes a turn produces.  Its ``phase`` field has its own
registry here (:class:`Phase` constants + :class:`PhaseSpec` catalogue +
:func:`build_phase` / :func:`emit_phase` constructors), so the full set of
status pushes is perceivable in ONE place instead of being reverse-engineered
from scattered ``phase='...'`` call sites, and uniformly optimisable at the
single construction chokepoint.  ``tests/test_phase_registry.py`` drift-guards
it both directions (emitted values ⊆ registry; frontend-handled values ⊆
registry; zero raw ``{'type': 'phase'`` literals outside this module).

Versioning
----------
``EVENT_CONTRACT_VERSION`` is bumped on any *breaking* change to an existing
event's shape (field removed/renamed/retyped).  Additive changes (new event
type, new optional field) do NOT bump it.  Mirrors the ``/api/v1`` policy.
