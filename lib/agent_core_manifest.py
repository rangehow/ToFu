"""lib/agent_core_manifest.py — The core/plugin boundary, declared.

This module is **documentation that executes**.  It names which parts of
``lib/`` constitute the reusable *agent base* (orchestration, model dispatch,
swarm scheduling, context compaction, push, task runtime) versus which parts
are *plugins* (concrete tools, concrete provider dialects).

Manifest first, directory second
--------------------------------
The base is what makes Tofu reusable across projects: the run loop, the
Planner→Worker→Critic endpoint mode, swarm scheduling, compaction, the push
hub.  Plugins are the swappable bits: individual tools and provider body
dialects.  The *guarantee* that the base never reaches back into a concrete
plugin is what keeps it a clean foundation — and that guarantee is enforced by
the AST test, not by the folder layout.

The directory IS being migrated to mirror this manifest, in stages:
* **Stage 1 (done, 2026-06):** self-contained leaves with no core-sibling
  back-imports — ``push.py``, ``task_runtime.py``, ``profiles.py`` — physically
  moved into ``lib/agent_core/``.  Thin shims at the old paths
  (``lib.push``, ``lib.task_runtime``, ``lib.agent_profiles``) re-export from
  the new homes, so existing call sites are unaffected.
* **Later stages:** the cross-cutting members (orchestrator, model_config,
  endpoint, …) stay named-in-place for now — moving them naively would create
  ``agent_core → tasks_pkg`` back-imports and rewrite ~960 import sites.  They
  migrate only when their sibling coupling is untangled.

Either way a folder can't stop an import — what enforces the boundary is the
AST test ``tests/test_agent_core_boundary.py``, which reads THIS manifest and
asserts:

    No CORE_MODULES file imports a CONCRETE_PLUGIN_MODULE.

Core may only reach plugins through the *registry seams* — ``lib.tools.registry``
(ToolSpec) and ``lib.llm_dispatch.provider_registry`` (BodyDialect) — which are
themselves part of the base.  Add a tool/provider via those seams and the base
stays untouched.

How to evolve the boundary
--------------------------
* New base capability (a new orchestration concern) → add its module prefix to
  ``CORE_MODULES``.
* New concrete tool family that core must NOT import directly → add its module
  to ``CONCRETE_PLUGIN_MODULES``.
* Need core to use a plugin → DON'T.  Route it through a registry seam instead.
  That's the whole point.
