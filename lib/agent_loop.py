"""lib/agent_loop.py — Shared multi-round tool-calling loop + abort seam.

Several engines run the SAME agentic shell: a bounded ``for round`` loop that
dispatches an LLM turn, and — if the turn asked for tools — executes each tool
and feeds the result back for another turn, until the model stops calling
tools (or a round cap is hit). Each engine hand-rolled that shell together
with its own abort/stop plumbing, and the abort *signal* itself was spelled
three different ways across the codebase:

  * ``threading.Event``          — the paper report / Q&A engines
    (``task['abort_event']``);
  * a ``task['aborted']`` flag    — the chat orchestrator / endpoint loop;
  * an ``abort_check`` callback   — swarm sub-agents.

This module unifies both concerns so future adopters need no re-plumbing:

  * :class:`AbortSignal` wraps ANY of the three mechanisms behind one
    ``.aborted`` predicate (and is itself callable / exposes ``.is_set`` so it
    drops straight into ``dispatch_stream(abort_check=…)``).
  * :func:`run_agent_loop` owns the round loop and the **three** abort-check
    placements, promoting the report engine's proven pattern to the default:

        (1) BEFORE each round      — don't start a turn after Stop;
        (2) AFTER the stream       — the stream may return a partial turn when
                                     the abort lands mid-flight;
        (3) BETWEEN queued tools   — a round may issue several slow tools; Stop
                                     pressed during one must skip the rest AND
                                     not start a fresh round. This is the check
                                     that fixed the "Stop has limited effect"
                                     bug — it MUST stay.

Everything engine-specific (the exact ``dispatch_stream`` kwargs, per-round
content buffering / interim-draft discard, tool-result events, usage
accumulation) stays in the caller via small hooks. The loop deliberately does
NOT catch exceptions — a dispatcher ``AbortedError`` propagates to the caller's
own handler unchanged.

Generic per-round machinery extensions (all opt-in, all owned HERE so no
engine re-implements them): ``before_round`` halt hook (timeouts),
``retry_bonus`` (premature-close ceiling expansion), ``execute_tools`` batch
hook (parallel pools), ``max_consecutive_tool_timeouts`` (timeout circuit
breaker) and ``on_round_end`` (crash-checkpoint placement).

    """Drive a bounded LLM tool-calling loop with the triple abort check.

    The loop owns control flow + the three abort-check placements; all
    engine-specific I/O is delegated to the hooks below. It never catches
    exceptions raised by ``dispatch`` / ``execute_tool`` (so a dispatcher
    ``AbortedError`` reaches the caller's handler).

    Args:
        abort: the unified abort signal (checked at all three points).
        max_tool_rounds: number of tool-eligible rounds. Rounds ``0 ..
            max_tool_rounds-1`` are offered ``round_tools``; the final round
            (index ``max_tool_rounds``) is offered ``None`` so the model must
            produce its answer without more tools.
        round_tools: tool schema list passed to ``dispatch`` on tool-eligible
            rounds (``None`` on the final round).
        dispatch: ``dispatch(rnd, tools) -> (msg, finish, usage)``. Performs
            the LLM turn (typically wrapping ``dispatch_stream`` with the
            engine's callbacks). ``msg`` must be a dict; a truthy
            ``msg['tool_calls']`` list drives tool execution.
        execute_tool: ``execute_tool(rnd, tool_call) -> None``. Runs ONE tool
            and is responsible for emitting the engine's tool events and
            appending the tool-result message. Called only AFTER the
            between-tools abort check passes.
        on_round_result: optional ``(rnd, msg, finish, usage) -> None`` hook
            fired after every dispatch (e.g. usage accumulation).
        on_tool_round: optional ``(rnd, msg) -> None`` hook fired once when a
            round HAS tool calls, before executing them (e.g. interim-draft
            discard + appending the assistant message to the history).
        retry_bonus: optional ``(rnd, msg, finish, usage) -> bool`` hook fired
            after ``on_round_result``. Returning True means "this turn ended
            prematurely (e.g. a premature stream close) — grant ONE extra
            round". It dynamically expands the round ceiling exactly like the
            chat orchestrator's ``_premature_retry_count`` (so even a
            no-tools turn can be retried), capped at ``max_retry_bonus``. When
            it fires, the round is NOT treated as a natural completion. Default
            ``None`` → the loop is byte-equivalent to the original for-range.
        max_retry_bonus: ceiling on total bonus rounds ``retry_bonus`` may
            grant, so a stuck premature-close can't loop forever (default 2,
            matching orchestrator's ``_PREMATURE_RETRY_MAX``).
        before_round: optional ``(rnd) -> str | None`` halt hook checked at
            the TOP of every round (after the abort check). Returning a
            non-empty reason string stops the loop with
            ``outcome.halted=True`` and ``exit_reason=<reason>`` — the generic
            seam for per-round guards the chassis does not own (swarm's
            wall-clock timeout is the first adopter). Returning None lets
            the round proceed.
        tools_terminal_round: when True (default), the final round (index
            ``max_tool_rounds``) is offered ``tools=None`` so the model must
            answer without more tools. When False, EVERY round is offered
            ``round_tools`` and the cap is a pure safety ceiling — the
            contract swarm's loop always had (its max-rounds exit extracts
            a partial answer from history instead of forcing a tool-less
            final turn).
        execute_tools: optional BATCH hook ``(rnd, tool_calls) ->
            dict | None``. When provided it replaces the per-tool
            ``execute_tool`` loop ENTIRELY (including the between-tools
            abort checks — the hook holds the ``abort`` signal and owns its
            own intra-batch behavior). This exists for engines like swarm
            that execute a round's tools in a parallel pool; prefer the
            per-tool ``execute_tool`` contract for new engines so the
            between-tools abort check (the "Stop has limited effect" fix)
            keeps biting. The hook MAY return a note dict; the chassis
            currently reads one key: ``'timed_out'`` (bool) — see
            ``max_consecutive_tool_timeouts``.
        max_consecutive_tool_timeouts: consecutive-tool-timeout circuit
            breaker (0 = off, default). When > 0, the chassis counts
            CONSECUTIVE batch notes carrying ``timed_out=True`` (a round
            whose note is falsy/absent resets the count) and halts the
            loop at the threshold with ``outcome.halted=True`` and
            ``exit_reason='tool_timeout'`` — the generic form of the
            chat orchestrator's ``_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_TOOL_TIMEOUTS`` guard.
            Detection stays with the engine (it knows what a timeout is);
            the counter + halt mechanics live here, not re-implemented
            per engine (mirrors the orchestrator: breaker break happens
            BEFORE the crash-checkpoint, so a halted round fires no
            ``on_round_end``).
        on_round_end: optional ``(rnd) -> None`` hook fired at the natural
            end of a round whose tools were executed WITHOUT an abort and
            WITHOUT a timeout-breaker halt — the seam for crash-recovery
            checkpoints (the orchestrator's throttled ``checkpoint_task_
            partial`` and swarm's per-round ``_checkpoint`` both live here;
            throttling policy stays in the hook, the PLACEMENT is owned by
            the chassis so the two engines can't drift into two shapes).
