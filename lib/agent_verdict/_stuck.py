"""lib/agent_verdict/_stuck.py — Non-convergence detectors for the agent loops.

Two independent guards:

  * Jaccard "stuck" detection on consecutive verifier feedbacks
    (``STUCK_JACCARD`` / ``_jaccard`` / ``detect_stuck``);
  * the diminishing-returns / no-value-progress guard on the per-turn ledger
    (``DIMINISHING_*`` constants / ``autopilot_progress_window`` /
    ``detect_diminishing_returns``).

Pure logic — imports only ``lib.log`` and ``lib.env_compat``.

#
#  WHY this exists — repetition (Jaccard) detection is NECESSARY BUT NOT
#  SUFFICIENT.  A verifier that keeps flagging a genuine-but-tiny item emits
#  NON-similar feedback each turn (so ``detect_stuck`` never fires) while the
#  worker ships a REAL edit each turn (so the zero-deliverable guard never
#  fires) — yet the loop makes no net progress toward the objective, burning
#  its whole budget polishing a triviality or tuning the same parameter.  This
#  guard catches exactly that: state-changing work that RE-TOUCHES the same
#  targets without resolving NEW objective items.
#
#  The signal is HARD, not prose-heuristic: the virtual user emits a structured
#  ``[PROGRESS: resolved=X remaining=Y]`` line each turn (X = acceptance-criteria
#  items verified DONE so far).  The per-turn ``resolved_delta`` (new items this
#  turn) + the worker's touched-file set feed a small ledger; the guard fires
#  only when the whole window carries a hard progress signal AND shows churn
#  without net progress.  Absent the structured signal it FAILS OPEN (cannot
#  prove no-progress → never fires).
