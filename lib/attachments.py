"""lib/attachments.py — Centralized re-access of uploaded chat attachments.

Single entry point (:func:`resolve_attachment`) that turns a *stable
reference* to a user-uploaded file back into its ORIGINAL bytes (images) or
extracted text (PDF / TXT / office docs), regardless of how the attachment
was stored:

  - **Images** live on disk under ``uploads_root()/images`` and are referenced
    from the DB by ``/api/images/<filename>`` URLs. They may also arrive as a
    ``data:`` URI or a remote ``http(s)://`` URL.
  - **PDF / TXT / doc** uploads do NOT keep the original file — the chat send
    path extracts text into the message row's ``pdfTexts`` list. So their only
    re-accessible form is that stored text, located by scanning the
    conversation messages for the matching entry.

Why this module exists (root cause it fixes): tools that want to re-read an
uploaded file (e.g. ``inspect_image`` zooming into a photo) previously only
accepted a local *filesystem path*. A chat-uploaded image has no such path the
model can name — it only ever sees an inline ``image_url`` block — so the model
would invent a bogus path (``/dev/null``) and the tool failed with
``File not found``. This module is the ONE place that maps a stable reference
(the one the backend computes and shows the model) to the real source.

Design invariants (see the project charter's front/back-contract decision):
  - The reference is a backend-computed FACT with a stable id; the model never
    fabricates a path. ``inspect_image`` and any future read-back tool call
    THIS resolver — they do not each re-implement resolution.
  - Source-first from disk / DB. For an image we read the on-disk file (or the
    DB base64), never the possibly-compacted-away inline data URI in the live
    context window.

This module is deliberately dependency-free of the ``executor_image`` package
(the image-gen path now delegates its ``_resolve_source_image`` here), so the
import graph stays acyclic.
