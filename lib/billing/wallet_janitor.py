"""lib.billing.wallet_janitor — Reclaim orphaned reservations.

A billable request reserves credits up front (``reserve(-estimate)``) and
releases the hold at the end inside :func:`lib.billing.wallet.settle`
(``reserve_release(+estimate)`` + ``debit(-actual)``). If the process
crashes — or the request aborts — between the reserve and the settle, the
hold is never released: the credits stay subtracted from the user's
*usable* balance forever, with nothing to ever reclaim them.

This module is the janitor the wallet docstring promised. It finds
``reserve`` ledger rows with no matching ``reserve_release`` for the same
``ref_id`` that are older than a TTL, and releases each one through the
existing idempotent :func:`lib.billing.wallet.reserve_release` path. Because
that path is keyed on ``ref_id``, the sweep is safe to run repeatedly: once a
hold is released the next sweep no longer sees it as orphaned.

Wiring: the scheduler auto-registers a ``reserve_reclaim`` task that calls
:func:`sweep_stale_reserves` every few minutes (see
``lib.scheduler.manager._ensure_default_reserve_reclaim_task``).
