"""Shared-cgroup memory-pressure defenses (self-check + relief + request guard).

Context (2026-07-20): Tofu often runs in a container whose cgroup memory limit
is the WHOLE machine (e.g. 200 GiB) and is SHARED with sibling processes + a
huge FUSE page/slab cache. When that shared cgroup fills to the ceiling (zero
swap), the kernel OOM killer SIGKILLs the highest-RSS process — which is
usually tofu — with a bare "Killed" and no traceback.

We cannot fix the root cause in code: the cgroup is shared, we lack
``CAP_SYS_RESOURCE`` (so we cannot lower our own ``oom_score_adj`` — the kernel
floors it at 0, verified live), and there is no swap. What we CAN do is stop
being the fattest, most-killable process and turn "mystery Killed" into a
logged, controlled degradation. Three defenses, all env-tunable:

  ① startup_self_check()  — at boot, if the cgroup is already near-full AND
     there is no swap, emit a CRITICAL log + audit record so the operator has
     durable evidence this is an environment squeeze, not a tofu bug.
  ② start_monitor()       — a low-frequency (>=30s) daemon thread that, when
     usage crosses the relief threshold, drops our own reclaimable caches and
     calls malloc_trim(0) to hand free heap back to the OS, shrinking our RSS.
  ③ check_request_headroom() — before assembling a LARGE LLM request body,
     if the cgroup is critically full, trim once and, if still critical, fail
     fast with a clear log (conv id + body size + usage%) instead of being
     SIGKILLed mid-assembly.

Everything degrades to a NO-OP when the cgroup / /proc is unreadable (bare
metal, macOS, restricted sandbox): a reader that cannot see ``memory.current``
returns ``None`` and every defense treats "unknown" as "proceed, do nothing".

Env vars (all optional):
  TOFU_CGROUP_WARN_PCT           default 90  — ① self-check trigger
  TOFU_CGROUP_RELIEF_PCT         default 92  — ② monitor relief trigger
  TOFU_CGROUP_REQUEST_PCT        default 95  — ③ request fail-fast trigger
  TOFU_CGROUP_POLL_SEC           default 30  — ② poll interval (clamped >=30)
  TOFU_CGROUP_REQUEST_MIN_BYTES  default 2_000_000 — ③ only guards bodies >= this
  TOFU_CGROUP_REQUEST_GUARD      default 1   — ③ set 0 to log-only (never raise)
  TOFU_CGROUP_DROP_LOGS          default 1   — relief also fadvise-drops logs/*.log*
  TOFU_CGROUP_LOGDROP_MIN_BYTES  default 1 MiB — size floor for the log drop
  TOFU_CGROUP_MATERIAL_PCT       default 0.1 — % of the cgroup limit a reclaim
                                               must reach to count as effective
                                               relief (below it, the streak
                                               towards the ineffective-relief
                                               CRITICAL keeps counting)
  TOFU_CGROUP_JOURNAL            default 1   — rolling pressure journal to
                                               logs/cgroup_pressure.log

What relief can and cannot do (measured 2026-07-31, do not re-litigate)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Defense ② can only free what THIS process owns: its heap caches and the page
cache of its own log files. On the shared cgroup that is noise. Over 406 real
reliefs, cgroup usage fell 18.3 GiB in total while 367 of them moved it by
exactly 0.0%, and the breakdown (12037 journal samples) was kmem 45–126 GiB
plus cache 55–156 GiB against a tofu RSS of only 0.16–9.9 GiB. The rest belongs
to sibling processes and FUSE slab, which we cannot reach.

So relief is a best-effort courtesy, NOT a mitigation, and the logging must not
imply otherwise: the relief line reports the MEASURED usage delta, and a run of
immaterial reclaims escalates once to CRITICAL saying the squeeze is external.
The old line printed the summed apparent size of the files advised, which
overstated the reclaim by 234x and made 341 consecutive near-OOM ticks read as
though they were being handled.
