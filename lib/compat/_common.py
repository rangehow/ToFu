OpenAI- and Anthropic-compat surfaces.

``translate_openai_request`` and ``translate_anthropic_request`` independently
mapped the SAME cross-format fields onto the Tofu ``cfg`` — model/preset,
temperature, max_tokens→maxTokens, top_p→topP, tools, tool_choice — and both
ran the identical "explicit tools → disable auto-injected tools" block followed
by ``apply_headless_personal_defaults(cfg)``. That duplication lived here now so
the two translators share one implementation and only carry their format-
specific extras (OpenAI: seed / response_format / reasoning_effort; Anthropic:
system / stop_sequences / metadata / thinking).

    understood — the PRE-4.7 form that Opus 4.7+ now rejects with HTTP 400 —
    so every Opus-5-era client fell through and had its stated intent dropped.

      * ``{'type': 'adaptive'}``  → enabled. THE enable form on 4.7+.
      * ``{'type': 'disabled'}``  → explicitly ``False``. Critically NOT the
        same as absent: the direct-model path in
        ``lib/tasks_pkg/model_config._resolve_model_config`` defaults
        ``thinkingEnabled`` to True, so leaving it None INVERTS an explicit
        "off" into "on" (measured on HEAD before this fix).
      * ``{'type': 'enabled', 'budget_tokens': N}`` → enabled, with the
        original token-band approximation preserved for pre-4.7 clients.
      * ABSENT → the model's REAL vendor default, because this surface
        emulates the Anthropic Messages API:
          - adaptive-generation Claude (``is_claude_opus_47``) thinks by
            default → True;
          - pre-4.7 Claude defaults off → False;
          - a NON-Claude model is left UNSET, since we are not emulating some
            other vendor's default and the existing downstream default must
            keep applying. Do not "simplify" this third branch into False —
            that would silently disable thinking for every GLM/Qwen/Kimi
            caller of this endpoint.

    The effort rung (see ``_extract_effort``) is applied whenever thinking is
    not disabled. It is deliberately NOT applied on the disabled path: effort
    is meaningless without thinking, and Anthropic rejects
    ``thinking=disabled`` combined with ``xhigh``/``max`` outright (HTTP 400).
