"""In-memory cache for conversation metadata (sidebar list).

Holds the ETag-validated JSON blob of the user's conversation metadata so
the sidebar can refresh cheaply without re-querying the DB on every poll.
``invalidate_meta_cache()`` is called on every conversation mutation
(create / update / delete); the TTL is a safety net, not the primary
freshness mechanism.

Relocated from ``routes/common.py`` (2026-06) so lib-layer mutators
(``lib/tasks_pkg/manager``, ``autopilot``, ``message_queue``) can invalidate
the cache without importing UP into the routes package. ``routes/common.py``
re-exports these names for backward compatibility.

Epic D4 (2026-07): the cache is now **user-keyed** (was a single global blob —
a multi-tenant correctness bug: user B could read user A's cached sidebar), the
conversation-list query is **bounded** with a ``LIMIT`` (was an unbounded
full-user-scan), and invalidation is **cross-replica** — it publishes on the
shared push_bus so a mutation on replica A clears replica B's stale entry.
Both public functions default ``user_id=DEFAULT_USER_ID`` so the existing
single-user call sites are byte-identical; under the ``inproc`` backend the
cross-replica publish collapses to a local re-clear (no dependency, no change).

    reconciles WITHOUT a manual refresh or waiting for the periodic poll.

    The pushed frame is intentionally tiny — ``{type, convId, rev, userId}`` — a
    targeting HINT, not the conversation data. The client rev-gates on it (a
    frame whose ``rev`` is <= its known ``_serverRev`` for that conv is a no-op,

    so the client falls back to a debounced sidebar refresh, not a body refetch.

    ``user_id`` scopes the frame for multi-user forward-safety (Epic D4): the
