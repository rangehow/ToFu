"""lib.conversations.project_board — the coordination BOARD (Pillar #3).

This is the piece that turns PERCEPTION (the Activity Feed) and shared INTENT
(the Charter) into actual AUTO-COORDINATION: a per-project board of coarse,
human-meaningful epics that conversations POST, CLAIM, and COMPLETE — so two
conversations of the same project stop colliding / duplicating work.

Locked design (owner, 2026-06-30):

  • **Soft, TTL-expiring lease — advisory, never a hard lock.** ``claim_task``
    sets ``owner_conv_id`` + ``lease_expires_at = now + TTL``. The lease is
    NOT enforced by a write-lock; it's a HINT injected into every sibling's
    prompt ("X is being worked by conversation …, avoid duplicating"). A
    crashed/abandoned conversation can NEVER deadlock the board because the
    lease expiry is evaluated AT READ TIME — an expired claim reads as
    ``open`` with no background reaper, no global cleaner thread.
  • **Per ``project_path``, never a process-global.** Every call addresses its
    project explicitly (the read/write-badge thrash guard).
  • **Coarse granularity.** Epics only — fine agent sub-steps belong to the
    Activity Feed, not the board.
  • **Feed-coupled.** post→(no feed; quiet), claim→``claimed``,
    complete→``completed``, block→``blocked`` (the last dead kind finally
    gets a producer here).

``status`` is the STORED column (open/claimed/done); ``effective_status`` is
what a reader sees after the at-read-time lease check (a stored ``claimed``
whose lease has expired is reported ``open``).

# ESCALATING cooldown so select_dispatchable stops re-dispatching it (which
# burned a billed agent turn every ~30 min to re-discover the same unmet dep).
# The cooldown is exponential in the block count and CAPPED, so a perpetually
# human-gated epic converges to a long sleep after a FEW retries (owner: "few
# retries then long sleep") instead of churning at fixed cadence forever. It is
# NOT the removed park shelf: it self-expires at READ time (no reaper) and needs

# TRANSIENT by definition, so it must NOT ride the escalating human curve
# (ordinary collaboration churn would otherwise ratchet a perfectly-landable
# epic toward the 24 h cap). Instead a sibling block tracks the LEASE clock: a
# flat window equal to one lease TTL, no escalation: the heartbeat stops
# churning the epic every sweep but retries after the window lapses. On the
# single shared checkout a sibling's commit is visible immediately, so a plain
# cooldown retry converges (the precise wait-on-path hold was removed 2026-07-13).
