"""lib.conversations.project_charter — the project "north star" (Pillar #2).

Where the Activity Feed (``project_feed.py``) is the LIVE pulse of what sibling
conversations are *doing*, the Charter is the slow-changing SHARED INTENT every
coordinating conversation reads: the project goal/north-star (``content``) plus
the COMMITTED key decisions (``decisions``). It is the thing that makes N
conversations feel like one mind instead of N amnesiac sessions.

Three-stage discipline (locked by owner, 2026-06-30):

  • **read** — any project-mode conversation may read the charter
    (``read_charter`` / the ``project_charter_read`` tool). Read-only.
  • **propose** — an agent may only PROPOSE an amendment
    (``propose_amendment`` / the ``project_charter_propose`` tool). A proposal
    writes ONE ``proposed_decision`` event into the Activity Feed and NEVER
    touches the ``project_charter`` table. Proposal ≠ commit.
  • **commit** — the actual charter mutation is HUMAN-GATED
    (``commit_charter``). It bumps ``version`` under an optimistic lock so two
    concurrent commits can't silently clobber, and emits ONE ``decided`` event
    so the commit is auditable in the feed. The frontend gate (a confirm UI)
    is wired in a later slice; this module provides the gated function +
    audit.

All functions key STRICTLY on ``project_path`` (a string) — never a
process-global singleton (the read/write-badge thrash trap). Best-effort feed
emission never raises into the caller.
