"""lib.conversations.project_dispatch — brain-driven dispatch (Pillar #5).

The last step that closes "无需人手": the Board lets conversations coordinate
when a human is driving them, but nothing on the board ever *starts* work. An
open epic with all dependencies met sits forever unless a human opens a tab.
This module is the spine that makes the project autonomous — it SELECTS
genuinely-pickable epics and KICKS them off into a conversation via the
existing ``message_queue`` (NOT a second turn-source), claiming each on
dispatch so siblings (and a re-dispatch pass) immediately avoid it.

Locked design (owner, 2026-06-30):

  • **Reuse the board's at-read-time lease eval.** ``select_dispatchable`` is
    built on ``read_board`` (whose ``_effective_status`` already reclaims an
    expired claim to ``open``) — there is exactly ONE deadlock path, not two.
  • **Dispatchable = open AND every dependency done AND no live claim.** An
    epic with an unfinished ``depends_on`` or a live (unexpired) claim is
    NEVER a candidate.
  • **Claim-on-dispatch = idempotency guard.** ``dispatch_epic`` claims the
    epic under the target conv BEFORE/with enqueuing the kickoff, so a second
    dispatch pass sees it as ``claimed`` and won't re-select it (no concurrent
    double-dispatch). The claim is the same soft lease — advisory, TTL-expiring.
  • **Trigger needs no new global / thread.** ``on_epic_completed`` is called
    from ``complete_task`` (a completion may unblock a dependent); it reuses
    the existing post-task ``dispatch_next_queued`` machinery to actually start
    the enqueued kickoff. No background poller is added here.
  • **Trigger needs no new global / thread.** ``on_epic_completed`` is called
    from ``complete_task`` (a completion may unblock a dependent); it reuses
    the existing post-task ``dispatch_next_queued`` machinery to actually start
    the enqueued kickoff. No background poller is added here.
  • **Event channel (2026-07-27).** The 30 s sweep is the crash/lease/strand
    SAFETY NET, not the starter: common flows dispatch AT THE EVENT —
    ``on_epic_posted`` (post time, idle existing target), ``on_conv_idle``
    (a task completes with an empty queue), ``on_epic_completed`` /
    ``on_epic_answered`` (dependency done / human answered).
  • **Per ``project_path``, never a process-global.**

    THE cold-start fix. The heartbeat sweep and the completion trigger only
    CLAIM + ENQUEUE a ``workflow_step`` kickoff; nothing else drains an idle
    conversation's queue — ``dispatch_next_queued`` fires ONLY after a task
    COMPLETES (the manager post-task hook) or on a human send. So a cold-start
    kickoff would rot in the queue until the 30-min soft lease expires, then
    ``_epic_already_queued`` blocks re-dispatch → the epic oscillates
    open↔claimed and is NEVER worked. This closes that gap: after enqueuing
    into a conv with NO live task, drain it here via the SAME
    ``dispatch_next_queued`` seam the completion hook uses, spawning the task
    from the scheduler thread.

    Invariants (owner-set):
      • Only drains a conv with NO live non-aborted task (reuses
        ``_conv_has_live_task`` — never races a running turn).
