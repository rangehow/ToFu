"""lib.conversations.project_feed — cross-conversation activity feed.

Pillar #1 of the "project brain" (see ``docs/PROJECT_BRAIN.md``). Where
``project_summary.py`` gives ambient awareness of what sibling conversations
*accomplished* (finished summaries), this module gives a LIVE pulse of what is
*happening right now* across all conversations of one project: an append-only,
per-project event log mirrored over the ``PushHub`` so the frontend can render
a real-time "Activity" stream.

Design (locked by owner, 2026-06-30):

  • **Keyed on ``project_path``**, never a process-global. Every call addresses
    its project explicitly; this module holds NO project identity (mirrors the
    per-conv-roots discipline that avoided the global ``_state`` thrash trap).
  • **Monotonic per-project ``seq``** computed inside the insert under a single
    module lock, so two concurrent emitters can't collide on the
    ``(project_path, seq)`` PK. The lock guards only the DB write — it carries
    no project state.
  • **Best-effort, never raises into the caller.** A feed failure (DB down,
    bad payload) is logged at WARNING and swallowed — emitting an activity
    event must NEVER break the task that triggered it (§2.2 + the project's
    "audit logic must not block" rule).
  • **Bounded log.** On each emit, rows older than ``_PROJECT_EVENTS_KEEP`` per
    project are pruned (cheap ``seq``-window delete) so the table can't grow
    without bound — the same cost-ceiling stance as the digest.
  • **Path never goes on the wire.** The PushHub channel routing key is
    ``sha1(project_path)[:16]`` (``project_channel_key``), computed identically
    on backend and frontend, so an absolute filesystem path is never leaked
    into the channel namespace or a push frame (§3.5).

The only LIVE producers in Pillar #1 are task-lifecycle ``started`` /
``completed`` / ``aborted`` events (plus a ``run_concluded`` roll-up for
autopilot runs). The richer ``decided`` / ``proposed_decision`` / ``blocked``
kinds are accepted by the validator now but gain producers only in later
pillars (Charter / Board).
