"""lib.conversations.project_peer — cross-conversation COMMUNICATION + INTERVENTION.

The Project Brain's first five pillars (feed / charter / board / presence /
dispatch) give conversations shared PERCEPTION and one-way engine-driven
dispatch, but no way for one conversation to *talk to* or *intervene in*
another. This module closes that gap with three agent verbs, all project-scoped
and all preserving the board's "advisory, never a hard lock" ethos:

  1. **``build_peer_status(project_path, conv_id?)``** — READ-ONLY live
     introspection. Joins ``presence.snapshot`` (who is active + current phase /
     file) with the live task registry (current round / status) and the board's
     ``claims_by_conv`` map (which epic each peer is advancing). This is LIVE
     state — not ``get_conversation`` history.

  2. **``send_peer_message(project_path, from_conv, to_conv, text)``** —
     agent-initiated peer messaging. Enqueues a ``KIND_PEER_MSG`` turn source
     into the target's queue (seen on its NEXT turn — NEVER interrupts a live
     turn mid-stream) and mirrors ONE ``note`` event into the activity feed,
     stamped with the sender. Rate-limited per (sender, target) so an A↔B
     chatter loop is mathematically bounded.

  3. **``intervene_peer(...)``** — advisory-first intervention. The DEFAULT is
     a high-priority advisory note ("stop, you're duplicating epic X"); a
     genuine hard abort of the peer's running task
     (``abort_running_tasks_for_conv``) is a SEPARATE, AUDIT-GATED action that
     refuses without an ``approved_by`` token — never a silent kill, and it
     aborts the task only, never the host/process.

Loop / storm guard (owner hard constraint — A→B→A auto-amplification must be
impossible):
  • **Rate limit per ordered (sender, target) pair** — at most
    ``_PEER_MSG_MAX_PER_WINDOW`` messages per ``_PEER_MSG_WINDOW_S``. With N
    conversations and every pair capped per window, total peer traffic per
    window is bounded by ``N·(N-1)·cap`` — a storm is impossible by
    construction, not by convention.
  • **No self-send** — a conversation can never message itself.
  • **No auto-relay** — receiving a peer message enqueues plain turn content;
    it invokes NO send path. The ONLY way a message is sent is an explicit
    model tool call, so nothing here can auto-trigger another send.

Every function keys STRICTLY on ``project_path`` (never a process-global) and is
best-effort — a sub-read failing degrades that field; the verbs never raise into
the caller.

    Advisory (``hard_abort=False``, the default): sends a high-priority advisory
    note (via :func:`send_peer_message`) the target sees next turn. This is the
    coordination nudge ("stop, you're duplicating epic X / re-read the board").

    Hard abort (``hard_abort=True``): a genuine abort of the target's running
    task. AUDIT-GATED — the coercive action requires human approval:

      • If a non-empty ``approved_by`` token is already supplied, it is honored.
      • Else, if an ``approval_fn`` is injected, it is CALLED to REQUEST human
        approval (this is what makes the coercive half reachable end-to-end —
        the handler wires ``approval_fn`` to the ``request_human_guidance`` UI
        seam). ``approval_fn(prompt: str)`` blocks until the human decides and
        returns the APPROVER identity (truthy) on grant, or a falsy value on
        deny. Grant → ``approved_by`` is stamped and the abort proceeds. Deny →
        ``denied_by_human`` (stays non-coercive).
      • Else (no token, no approval mechanism — e.g. a headless caller with no
        human) → refused via the pure gate.

    When authorized, emits ``audit_log('intervention', ...)`` and calls
    ``abort_running_tasks_for_conv`` (aborts the TASK only — never touches the
    host/process). Never a silent kill.
