"""lib.conversations.project_status — the human↔brain status lane (Pillar #7).

Where the first six pillars (Activity Feed, Charter, Board, presence, per-conv
summaries, peer comms) are agent-facing blackboards the human can read and poke
per-cell, THIS pillar is the human's window back in as automation runs ahead:

  • a **persistent, append-only history of project-status snapshots** — the
    durable memory of *where the project IS* (the Charter is durable memory of
    *intent*; the Feed is a raw ephemeral pulse; per-conv summaries were never
    aggregated). The human works with facts that drift over time and needs the
    TRAIL — how the project got here — not a single overwritten narrative.

  • a **synthesis generator** that reads LIVE pillar state and produces one
    bounded narrative answering "where are we / are we drifting from the
    charter", with an explicit alignment-to-north-star read.

Design invariants (owner-locked 2026-07-08; see docs/PROJECT_BRAIN_STATUS_LANE.md):
  • **Keyed strictly on ``project_path``** — never a process-global singleton.
  • **Append-only**, monotonic per-project ``seq`` minted under one module lock
    (mirrors ``project_feed.emit_project_event`` exactly).
  • **Laziness (reuse ``ensure_summary``'s discipline):** a new snapshot is
    minted only when the pillar-state FINGERPRINT changed since the last
    snapshot; a quiescent project is never re-synthesized (no LLM), and repeated
    tab-opens are free.
  • **Best-effort** — any pillar sub-read failing degrades that field; the
    generator NEVER raises into a caller, and keeps the previous snapshot rather
    than writing an empty one on LLM failure.
  • **HUMAN-FACING ONLY** — this memory is NEVER injected into
    ``lib/tasks_pkg/system_context.py`` / sibling agent prompts. That would blur
    the human↔brain lane into the agent↔agent lane and re-raise the
    coupling/storm concerns. (Guarded by test_project_status_no_ambient_injection.)
