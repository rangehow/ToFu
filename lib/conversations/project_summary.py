"""lib.conversations.project_summary — cross-conversation project awareness.

Layer 2 of the cross-conversation work (see ``docs/CROSS_CONV_AWARENESS.md``).
Where Layer 1 made ``list_conversations`` project-aware, this module gives the
model *ambient* awareness of sibling conversations of the same project, without
the user attaching anything.

Two pieces:

  • **Lazy summary generation** — ``ensure_summary(conv_id)`` produces a 1-3
    sentence "outcome + key decisions" description of a conversation via the
    cheap model (reusing the ``title_gen`` dispatch pattern) and caches it in
    ``settings.projectSummary = {text, generated_at, msg_count_at_gen, lang}``.
    It regenerates only when the conversation has grown *materially* past the
    msg_count it was last summarized at — so a static conversation is never
    re-summarized. Triggered lazily (post-first-reply, and on first
    ``get_conversation`` of a sibling), never eagerly for every conversation.

  • **Bounded project digest** — ``build_project_digest(project_path, ...)``
    returns a compact, bounded list (top ``DIGEST_MAX_SIBLINGS``) of the most
    recently-updated *other* conversations of the same project, each rendered
    as ``title — summary [id]``. Injected always-on in project mode by
    ``lib/tasks_pkg/system_context.py`` so the model knows the siblings exist.
    Its header only instructs the model to ``get_conversation(id)`` /
    ``list_conversations()`` when those tools are actually registered for the
    turn (``conv_tools_available``); otherwise the siblings are surfaced for
    ambient awareness only, naming no tool the model cannot call.

Design notes / tradeoffs are documented in ``docs/CROSS_CONV_AWARENESS.md``.
