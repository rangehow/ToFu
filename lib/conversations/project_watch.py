"""lib.conversations.project_watch — the human's standing "watch list" (Pillar #7).

The status lane (``project_status.py``) lets the human ASK the project a one-shot
question and get an ephemeral answer. This module is its DURABLE counterpart: a
standing list of things the HUMAN cares about — concerns, open questions,
goals — that the brain ADDRESSES on a recurring basis, keeping an append-only
trail of its responses per item so the human can see how the answer to a
concern DRIFTS over time.

Owner-locked decisions (2026-07-08; goals-inject-directly 2026-07-30):
  1. **A GOAL is live because it exists — it never travels through the
     charter.** ``kind=goal`` items render as their own ``[PROJECT GOALS]``
     prompt block (see :func:`render_goals_injection_block`), read straight
     from this lane. ``concern`` / ``question`` stay human-facing-only and are
     NEVER injected; their one bridge to agents is still
     ``promote_watch_item`` → ``commit_charter(add_decision=…)``.

     This replaces the 2026-07-30-morning design in which a goal was COPIED
     into the charter's north-star ``content`` column. That copy is what forced
     every mechanism now deleted: two copies of one sentence need "which side
     moved?" detection, a three-state badge, a replacement-preview card, and a
     version gate. One copy needs none of them. The owner's framing: *goals are
     goals; they should work without being in the charter.* A goal's state
     model is therefore the whole of: it exists, and it is not resolved.

     **Single-goal-ness is NOT enforced and deliberately so.** Several goals is
     a legitimate thing for a project to have; they all inject. The charter's
     ``content`` column remains the human's separate north-star statement.
  2. **Append-only response trail per item** (bounded), not latest-only — the
     drift is the signal.
  3. **Cadence = on-tab-open + event-driven now** (reuse the staleness gate so a
     quiescent project costs nothing). The closed-panel scheduler cadence is a
     deliberately-deferred follow-up.
  4. **The promotion verdict is COMPUTED, never stored** — and applies ONLY to
     concern/question now. The ``promoted`` column is a one-shot audit marker
     that cannot answer "is this reaching agents right now": measured on the
     live project, ``promoted=1`` while ``read_charter()`` reported
     ``exists=False``, i.e. the badge asserted something already untrue.
     :func:`promotion_state` recomputes it against the LIVE charter per read.
     A goal has no promotion state at all — it is injected or it is resolved.

All functions key STRICTLY on ``project_path`` / ``item_id`` — never a
process-global. Best-effort throughout; the address generator never raises.
