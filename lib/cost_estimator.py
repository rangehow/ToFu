"""lib/cost_estimator.py — Per-round cost estimation + budget gate.

Two responsibilities:

1. ``estimate_usage_cost(usage, model, provider_id=None)`` converts a
   single usage dict (Anthropic OR OpenAI shape) into a USD figure using
   ``lib.pricing.lookup_pricing``.  Used by the orchestrator to evaluate
   ``max_budget_usd`` after every round.

2. ``check_budget(task, accumulated_usage, model, max_budget_usd, ...)``
   short-circuits the agent loop when the running total exceeds the cap.

Inspired by Claude Agent SDK's ``max_budget_usd`` option — a hard $-cap
that halts the loop deterministically (vs token caps which are per-call,
not per-task).

Design rules
------------
* Return zero-cost on missing pricing data, NEVER raise.  Cost estimation
  is best-effort: an unknown model should not break the loop.
* Token-shape tolerant — accept both Anthropic and OpenAI keys.
* Cache discounts respected — ``cacheWriteMul`` / ``cacheReadMul`` from
  ``MODEL_PRICING`` are applied.  Free / unknown cache fields default to
  the standard input price.

def _split_tokens(usage: dict | None) -> tuple[int, int, int, int]:
    """Return (uncached_input, cache_write, cache_read, output) tokens.

    Tolerates both Anthropic and OpenAI usage shapes:

      * Anthropic — ``input_tokens``, ``cache_creation_input_tokens``,
        ``cache_read_input_tokens``, ``output_tokens``.
        Convention: ``input_tokens`` excludes cache hits.

      * OpenAI — ``prompt_tokens``, ``completion_tokens``, plus
        ``prompt_tokens_details: {cached_tokens}`` (some providers).
        Convention: ``prompt_tokens`` already includes cached tokens.

    The returned ``uncached_input`` is the count we pay full input price for.

    ★ The convention decision is DELEGATED to ``lib.cost.split_input_tokens``,
      the single chokepoint that already owns it. This module used to carry a
      third independent copy — the magnitude heuristic
      ``if cw + cr > 0 and inp_raw > cw + cr`` — which
      ``usage_cache_convention``'s docstring names a "latent 10x BILLING BUG"
      and which pt_28375442 removed from the display and wallet paths.

      Why it mattered most here: this function feeds ``estimate_usage_cost`` →
      ``check_budget`` → the orchestrator's per-round budget gate, and the
      error direction is OVER-estimation — so a cost that never happened could
      abort a task mid-flight. Measured before the fix: a full cache hit on the
      OpenAI wire (``prompt_tokens == cached_tokens == 82843``) needs
      ``inp_raw > cw + cr`` to be recognised, which is False at exact equality,
      so the whole cached prompt was billed at full input price instead of 0.

      Equality is the COMMON case (a fully cached prefix), not an edge case,
      which is why a 4-example suite that never crossed the boundary stayed
      green over a live cliff.
