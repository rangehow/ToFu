#  Tofu-level heartbeat
#
#  The shared FUSE-mounted pgdata is occasionally inherited from a
#  previous host that didn't shut down cleanly: its postmaster may still
#  be TCP-reachable, but no tofu process there is actively using it.
#  A new server.py on this host would otherwise read .pg_owner_host,
#  see the remote PG answers, and route every DB call across the
#  network — only to time out when the abandoned remote eventually
#  drops or stalls.
#
#  The heartbeat file (`pgdata/.tofu_heartbeat`) is written by the
#  process that actually owns the local PG, refreshed every
#  _HEARTBEAT_REFRESH_S seconds, and cleared on clean shutdown. A new
#  startup considers the previous owner alive iff the heartbeat is
#  fresher than _HEARTBEAT_TTL_S. Otherwise it auto-heals: clears the
#  ownership markers and starts PG locally.

#  Cross-host startup lock (anti-concurrent-pg_ctl race guard)
#
#  When two tofu hosts share the same FUSE-mounted pgdata, both can
#  simultaneously conclude "PG is down, I'll start it" and race to
#  pg_ctl start. Each new postmaster sees the OTHER host's PID in
#  postmaster.pid, immediate-shutdowns with "lock file contains wrong
#  PID", and leaves truncated WAL records — after which every further
#  startup on either side PANICs with "could not locate a valid
#  checkpoint record". The heartbeat alone can't prevent this: it only
#  defends sequential handoff (A dies → B takes over), not concurrent
#  startup within the same 60–120s window.
#
#  The fix: use an advisory POSIX flock() on a lock file INSIDE pgdata.
#  Since pgdata is the shared FUSE mount, the lock is visible to every
#  host that could race with us. The lock is acquired BEFORE any
#  pg_ctl start call and held for the process's lifetime via a retained
#  file descriptor — a process crash releases it, but no graceful exit
#  is needed. If another host already holds it, we abort the start
#  attempt and let the caller fall back to SQLite (or retry next cycle).
#
#  flock() over FUSE is best-effort; if the backend doesn't support it
#  we get IOError/OSError at acquire time and we LOG but do NOT skip
#  the start — we preserve the pre-fix behavior so hosts without FUSE
#  flock support aren't newly regressed. Audit-log emits a signal so
#  multi-host collisions are easy to grep from outside.

#  Instance-identity stamp — the copy/move detector
#
#  Ownership markers (`.pg_owner_host`, `.tofu_heartbeat`, `postmaster.pid`)
#  live INSIDE pgdata, which is exactly the directory people copy. When the
#  whole project is copied to a NEW path (a colleague's home, `tofu-meituan2`,
#  an open-source clone) the markers come along and the fresh instance trusts
#  them — silently routing every DB call back to the ORIGINAL machine's PG
#  via FUSE cross-machine discovery. Result: shared data, privacy leak, no
#  error shown.
#
#  The discriminator is the pgdata's own ABSOLUTE PATH. Legitimate cross-host
#  sharing happens at the SAME mount path (two machines, one FUSE pgdata);
#  a copy lands at a DIFFERENT path. So we stamp the canonical path (plus a
#  random instance id + creation ts) into `.pg_instance_id` whenever this
#  process takes local ownership. On a later startup, if the stamped path no
#  longer matches the current canonical path, the directory was copied/moved
#  → we ignore ALL inherited ownership markers and take over locally. This
#  strengthens — never weakens — the same-path multi-host failover logic,
#  which continues to rely on `.pg_owner_host` + heartbeat.

    1. WAL recovery PANIC (e.g. "invalid resource manager ID in

       process itself launched fine; the startup sub-process aborts

    2. Concurrent-start race: another host's postmaster wrote a
