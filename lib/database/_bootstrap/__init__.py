"""PostgreSQL server management — auto-bootstrap, start, stop, remote discovery.

Facade package (facade-preserving split of the former single-module
``_bootstrap.py``). Every public/private symbol AND every back-compat
re-export the old module exposed is re-exported here, so that
``from lib.database._bootstrap import X`` and ``import lib.database._bootstrap
as b; b.X`` behave byte-identically to the pre-split layout. The import path
``lib.database._bootstrap`` is UNCHANGED.

Extracted from _core.py for modularity. Called from _core at import time.
Cross-platform: works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

Sub-modules
-----------
  _config       — managed postgresql.conf tuning block (+ restart-to-apply)
  _verify       — identity / health / binary-presence probes
  _process      — port read, quiet stop, port scan, shutdown _stop_pg
  _database     — createdb + SQL-dump restore
  _orchestrate  — _bootstrap_pg / _try_explicit_pg_target / _ensure_pg_running

BACK-COMPAT RE-EXPORT CHAINS (do not remove)
--------------------------------------------
Ownership / lock / heartbeat / host-identity live in ``_pg_ownership``;
seed/dump/legacy migration live in ``_pg_seed``; backup / base-backup / PITR /
self-heal live in ``_pg_backup``. All three are re-imported here so every
caller of ``_bootstrap.<name>`` (incl. _core.py, pg_admin.py, the scheduler,
desktop/, and the pg_*/tier_b/seed test suites) keeps resolving. Each sibling
resolves its own call-outs back into core/bootstrap lazily → no import cycle.
