"""lib/database/_core.py — Dual-backend database layer (PostgreSQL primary, SQLite fallback).

Tries PostgreSQL first (full concurrency, JSONB, tsvector). If PG is unavailable
(no binary, no psycopg2, bootstrap failure), falls back to SQLite with WAL mode.

All sub-concerns for PG:
  _sql_translate.py  — SQL compatibility translation (regex, cache)
  _wrappers.py       — DictRow, PgCursor, PgConnection, sanitization
  _schema.py         — Schema DDL, migrations, version cache
  _bootstrap.py      — PG server management (start/stop/discover)

This file retains:
  - Config constants (PG_HOST, PG_PORT, PG_DSN, DB_PATH, domains)
  - Connection resilience parameters
  - Connection pool & request-scoped / thread-local helpers
  - init_db() entry point (delegates to _schema)
  - Backend auto-detection on import

def heal_toast_corruption():
    """Auto-heal TOAST-chunk corruption in the ``conversations`` table.

    Background
    ----------
    When a PostgreSQL cluster is copied between machines (e.g. a naïve
    ``rsync`` / ``tar`` of ``data/pgdata/`` via a FUSE mount) while the
    source PG is live, the destination can end up with rows whose
    out-of-line TOAST chunks were never flushed to the destination
    filesystem.  Any SELECT over the affected row — and, crucially, any
    INSERT whose index entry points at the missing chunk — fails with:

        ERROR: missing chunk number 0 for toast value N in pg_toast_XXXXX

    INSERTs time out after ``statement_timeout`` seconds (default 120 s),
    which breaks the user's "Send" button (every ``PUT /api/conversations``
    ends in 500).  ``export.py`` has been updated to use ``pg_dumpall``
    instead of raw-copying pgdata/, so this bug should never appear on
    fresh exports — but existing deployments that were seeded from a
    hot-copy still carry the damage.  This function detects and repairs
    it automatically on every startup so the user never notices.

    Strategy
    --------
    1.  Probe the table with a fast ``COUNT(*)``.  On success → no
        corruption, return quietly.
    2.  On toast failure → iterate all conversation IDs (the id column
        has no TOAST) and for each one probe a SELECT of the TOASTed
        columns under a short statement_timeout.  Any row that errors
        with "missing chunk" is unrecoverable.
    3.  DELETE unrecoverable rows by id (deletes only touch the heap &
        index, not the missing TOAST chunk → always succeed).
    4.  ``VACUUM (FULL) conversations`` + ``REINDEX TABLE conversations``
        to reclaim space and rebuild indexes free of dangling pointers.
    5.  ``audit_log`` every deleted id + the summary stats.

    PG-only; silent no-op on SQLite.
