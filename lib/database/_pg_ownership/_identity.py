"""Instance-identity stamp — the copy/move detector.

Owns the ``_INSTANCE_ID_FILE`` name. No mutable module global lives here (the
stamp lives on disk), so there is no ``global`` rebind to keep local; the
grouping is by cohesion.

Ownership markers (``.pg_owner_host``, ``.tofu_heartbeat``, ``postmaster.pid``)
live INSIDE pgdata, which is exactly the directory people copy. When the whole
project is copied to a NEW path the markers come along and the fresh instance
trusts them — silently routing every DB call back to the ORIGINAL machine's PG
via FUSE cross-machine discovery. The discriminator is the pgdata's own
ABSOLUTE PATH: legitimate cross-host sharing happens at the SAME mount path; a
copy lands at a DIFFERENT path. We stamp the canonical path into
``.pg_instance_id`` whenever we take local ownership; a later mismatch means
the directory was copied → ignore inherited markers and take over locally.

Patch-safety: cross-submodule constants / helpers (``_OWNER_ID_FILE``,
``_HEARTBEAT_FILE``, ``_clear_heartbeat``) are resolved through the
``lib.database._pg_ownership`` facade.
