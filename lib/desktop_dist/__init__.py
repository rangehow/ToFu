"""lib/desktop_dist — server-hosted desktop-installer distribution.

Why this package exists
-----------------------
The desktop download used to be a link to GitHub Releases, and the status
endpoint computed per-platform links by probing ``api.github.com``
SYNCHRONOUSLY inside an async route (up to 6 s on the event loop every
cache expiry — the measurable stall behind "this element always takes much
longer to load"). Both the probe and the client's own fetch also depended
on the public GitHub network being reachable and fast, which is not a
given from either side.

This package makes the SERVER the download origin:

  platforms — which installer does this visitor need (UA/arch narrowing,
              release-payload parsing). Extracted from
              ``routes/api_v1/desktop.py``; the route re-exports the names
              so existing guards see no drift.
  store     — the on-disk artifact store + manifest (traversal-proof
              resolution, stale-while-revalidate, built-beats-mirrored
              version preference).
  mirror    — background refresh of the published GitHub assets (the
              platforms this server cannot build itself).
  builder   — native on-server build for the platform the server CAN
              build (its own), wired in a later slice.
  wintoolchain — userspace Wine toolchain (proot + ubuntu guest) for the
              WINDOWS build: the four measured container traps (seccomp
              access(2), proot -R /etc/group bind, untranslated
              faccessat2, preloader SIGSYS) are baked into its recipe and
              pinned by tests/test_wintoolchain.py.
  winbuilder — the WINDOWS frozen-payload build (Half A): git-archive →
              nuget CPython → pip (CI recipe) → PyInstaller → boot smoke,
              cached per (git_sha, deps stamp). Its own two measured
              traps (wine swallows exit codes → sentinel protocol; host
              python env is poison → scrubbed allowlist) are pinned by
              tests/test_winbuilder.py.

The request path performs ZERO network: it reads the store. All network
happens in the mirror's single-flight background thread.
