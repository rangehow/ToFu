"""JS bundler — concatenate app scripts into a single bundle at startup.

Eliminates the HTTP/1.1 waterfall problem where browsers limit to 6 concurrent
connections per host, causing 18 JS files to download in 3-4 serial waves.
With the bundle, the browser fetches 1 file (gzip ~250KB) in a single request.

The bundle is rebuilt at startup and whenever any source file changes.
No npm/webpack/build step required — pure Python concatenation + a
conservative, dependency-free minify pass (``_minify_js``, see below).

When a ``node`` toolchain WITH ``esbuild`` happens to be present, an OPTIONAL
stronger minify pass (``_esbuild_minify``) is layered on top of the concatenated
bundle — it mangles function-local identifiers and shrinks syntax for a further
~12% gzip / ~19% raw reduction. It is strictly best-effort and fail-open: absent
or broken esbuild → the dependency-free ``_minify_js`` output is served
unchanged, so a bare ``python server.py`` (e.g. a Mac with no node) is byte-for
-byte identical to before. See ``_esbuild_minify`` for the safety argument (why
script-mode esbuild never renames the top-level globals index.html's inline
``onclick=`` handlers depend on, and never tree-shakes a top-level definition).

def _minify_js(src: str) -> str:
    r"""Conservatively strip comments + non-semantic whitespace from JS.

    A single forward char-scan that tracks lexical state — string literals
    (``'`` / ``"``), template literals (`` ` `` incl. ``${ }`` interpolation
    with its own brace depth), and regex literals — so a ``//`` or ``/* */``
    that lives INSIDE one of those is never mistaken for a comment. Outside
    those contexts it drops line (``//``) and block (``/* */``) comments.

    LINE-PRESERVING by design: newlines are kept (only blank lines, leading
    indentation, and trailing whitespace are dropped). Keeping ``\n`` means the
    transform can only ever DELETE comment bytes and horizontal whitespace —
    never move code across a line boundary — so it introduces NO
    Automatic-Semicolon-Insertion hazard and can never fuse two tokens. This is
    the same fail-safe philosophy as ``lib/css_bundler._minify_css``; the
    regex-vs-divide call is deliberately conservative (when unsure, treat ``/``
    as division and leave the bytes intact) so a misjudgement can only leave a
    comment un-stripped, never corrupt real code.

    Returns the source UNCHANGED on any unexpected condition (never raises).
    ``build_bundle`` still runs the ``node --check`` gate on the concatenated
    result, so even a latent minifier bug degrades to "serve the un-minified
    fallback", never a white screen.

# ── Load-bearing modules ──────────────────────────────────────────────
# If ANY of these is corrupt or missing, a bundle built from "whatever
# remains" boots into a silently-crippled app (e.g. a skipped push.js kills
# live updates, the "N running" badge, and translate status with NO error and
# nothing actionable in the logs). For a critical file we therefore REFUSE to
# ship a partial bundle and return None, so routes/common.py falls back to the
# individual <script> tags where index.html's load-guard SURFACES the failure
# to the user. Non-critical files keep the skip-and-continue degradation.
# INVARIANT: every entry MUST be in _BUNDLE_FILES (guarded by
# tests/test_bundle_corruption_guard.py) so a rename can't silently empty it.
_CRITICAL_FILES = frozenset({
    'i18n.js',   # t() — used by every module
    'core.js',   # foundational module state (apiUrl, conversations, config, …)

    'push.js',   # live server-push channel (pushSubscribe / notifications)
    'main.js',   # boot orchestrator IIFE
})

# ── DEFERRED feature bundle ───────────────────────────────────────────
# Heavy, rarely-first-used feature modules that are NOT needed for first
# paint or chat. They are built into a SEPARATE bundle (feature-<hash>.js)
# that the browser fetches ON DEMAND — the first time the user opens the
# feature — via static/js/feature-loader.js (in the core bundle), which
# installs a lazy stub for each entry point and swaps in the real function
# once the feature bundle loads. Both bundles share window scope (plain
# concatenated <script>s, NOT ES modules), so the dependency ordering
# WITHIN this list still matters (task-mode.js reads orchestration.js's
# _ORCH_* at runtime → orchestration.js first).
#
# SAFE-TO-DEFER criteria (audited 2026-07-05): nothing in the core bundle
# references a deferred module's symbols at IIFE/LOAD time (only inside
# function bodies, all typeof-guarded), and each has a clean user-triggered
# onclick= entry point in index.html. Modules with load-time side effects
# are deliberately KEPT in the core bundle: scheduler/optimizer/timer
# (badge-polling IIFEs at load), and myday (its `_mydayScheduleReminder()`
# auto-runs at load — myday.js:1326). NOTE: image-gen.js was previously listed
# here as blocked by "its core-owned `imageGenMode` global" — that was WRONG:
# `imageGenMode` is declared in core.js:145 and every load-time reader
# (`_applyImageGenUI`, conv-restore at main.js:597) lives in main.js/core, NOT
# in image-gen.js, whose own top-level is only var/let/const declarations. It
# is now correctly DEFERRED (below).

# ── Bundle-manifest freshness (2026-07-24 / 2026-07-31 incident class) ──
# The four manifests above are bound ONCE at import. A long-running server
# whose manifest file changes AFTER process start (a deploy, a sibling edit)
# used to keep rebuilding from that import-time-frozen binding: the rebuild
# gate (_source_max_mtime stats THIS file) correctly fired, but the build
# then assembled the OLD list — silently dropping every newly-added file
# from the shipped bundle (2026-07-24 core/model_caps.js → every model
# picker threw ReferenceError; 2026-07-31 core/conv_save.js → ReferenceError
# at 108 call sites, with core/conv_verify_retry.js missing from the same
# artifact). The fix: build_bundle() re-reads the manifests from DISK via
# _refresh_manifest() below, so the build can never lag the file. Keep the
# four assignments PLAIN module-level literals: _extract_manifest_from_source
# parses them with ast.literal_eval, and a smarter expression (concat /
# comprehension / conditional import) makes the refresh fail LOUDLY (ERROR
# log + last-known-good kept), never silently. Guarded by
