"""lib/llm_dispatch/big_prefix_gate.py — Per-key big-prefix admission control.

Why this exists
===============
Anthropic's prompt cache is keyed **per API key**: each upstream key has one
shared server-side cache namespace with a finite working set.  When several
conversations with LARGE prompt prefixes (25万–43万 token opus turns) are
in-flight on the *same* key at once, they can LRU-evict each other's cached
prefix — an eviction costs a full ``cache_creation`` re-write + 0% read on
the next round, then the prefix "rebounds" to a hit once it re-writes and the
competitor gets evicted instead.  Live evidence (2026-07-16, key ``key_0``):
in a dense 20:42–20:47 window 5 concurrent opus convs oscillated between
``cache_r=0`` (whole prefix evicted), ``cache_r≈79k`` (only the shared
system/tools floor survived) and full read-back — the mutual-eviction signature.

⚠ SCOPE / HONESTY: this concurrency eviction is a REAL but SUB-DOMINANT cause.
The dominant cache-miss cause in this system is CLIENT-side — already-cached
prefix bytes re-serialized differently across turns (see the ``<bytes>`` /
prefix-mutation detection in ``lib/tasks_pkg/cache_tracking``); when the client
wire bytes are stable, misses have been observed to drop to ~zero regardless of
key count. Do NOT read this gate as "the" fix for prefix-cache misses — it only
bounds the concurrency residual, and on a single key it can only SERIALIZE the
working set, not add capacity.

This gate caps the number of concurrently-resident BIG-prefix requests on any
one key.  A request over :func:`threshold_tokens` acquires a per-key slot before
its stream and releases it after; when the key is at capacity a new big request
briefly WAITS instead of piling on and evicting a warm prefix.  Small requests
(translate, cheap models, short turns) never gate.

It is a *soft* guard: bounded wait, then proceed degraded — better to serve a
big prefix slightly late than to block a task forever.  Fully env-gated and
reversible.

Env knobs
---------
``TOFU_BIG_PREFIX_GATE``            — master switch (default on).
``TOFU_BIG_PREFIX_THRESHOLD_TOKENS`` — prefix size (est. tokens) above which a
                                     request is "big" and gated (default 150000).
``TOFU_BIG_PREFIX_MAX_PER_KEY``    — max concurrent big requests per key
                                     (default 2).
``TOFU_BIG_PREFIX_WAIT_MS``        — max time to wait for a slot before
                                     proceeding degraded (default 45000).

Residency-aware admission (2026-07-16)
======================================
The original semaphore held ONLY for the in-flight ``stream_chat`` duration
(seconds). But Anthropic prompt-cache eviction is a *cache-RESIDENCY*
phenomenon: a cached prefix stays in the key's pool for the cache TTL (~5m/1h),
long after the stream returns. Two big prefixes whose STREAMS never overlap
(they run back-to-back) still coexist in the pool for minutes and LRU-evict
each other — a competition the stream-only semaphore is structurally blind to.
Live evidence: 94.8% of opus floor-misses had a prefix ≥150k (the gated size)
yet the stream gate fired only 6× / hit capacity once; the misses were
time-ISOLATED (median 1/minute), NOT concurrent streams.

So admission now counts the DISTINCT big prefixes RESIDENT on a key within a
residency-TTL window (``TOFU_BIG_PREFIX_RESIDENCY_TTL_MS``, default = the
gateway cache TTL, 5min). A request whose conv is ALREADY resident (warm) is
admitted free — re-using a warm prefix is exactly the goal, not a new
competitor. A NEW distinct big prefix waits up to the budget when the resident
working set is full (``TOFU_BIG_PREFIX_RESIDENCY_MAX``, default = max_per_key),
then proceeds degraded.

HONEST LIMIT: on a SINGLE key pool this can only SERIALIZE the active working
set — it cannot spread load. Sustained >capacity distinct-big-conv load still
evicts (that needs route (i): a second key = a second cache namespace). This is
a working-set bound, not a capacity fix.

Residency env knobs
-------------------
``TOFU_BIG_PREFIX_RESIDENCY``       — residency-aware admission on (default on).
``TOFU_BIG_PREFIX_RESIDENCY_MAX``   — max distinct big prefixes resident per key
                                     (default = max_per_key).
``TOFU_BIG_PREFIX_RESIDENCY_TTL_MS``— how long a prefix counts as resident after
                                     its last use (default 300000 = 5min).
``TOFU_BIG_PREFIX_RESIDENCY_WAIT_MS``— SHORT wait (ms) a new distinct prefix
                                     gives a saturated set before degrading
                                     (default 1500; distinct from the 45s
                                     stream budget — see residency_wait_budget_ms).
``TOFU_BIG_PREFIX_RESIDENCY_LRU_BOUND``— keep the resident table ≤ cap by LRU
                                     eviction (default on); models the gateway
                                     pool's finite LRU so a DEGRADED pass-through
                                     evicts the LRU resident instead of inflating
                                     the working set past cap.
