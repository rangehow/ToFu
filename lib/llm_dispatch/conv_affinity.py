"""lib/llm_dispatch/conv_affinity.py — Conversation-sticky slot routing.

Why this exists
===============
Anthropic's prompt cache is keyed **per API key**: each upstream key has its
own independent server-side cache namespace.  The dispatcher
(``_pick`` in ``dispatcher.py``) chooses the lowest-``score()`` slot
**independently for every request**, and ``Slot.score()`` adds a
``random.uniform(0.95, 1.05)`` jitter on top of inflight / RPM penalties.  So
when a single model has two or more keys, the chosen ``(key, model)`` slot
flips between rounds of the SAME conversation — and every flip lands on a key
whose cache does not hold this conversation's prefix, costing a full
``cache_creation`` write + 0% read (observed on conv ``mqjlcopple4o60``:
two full ~95–133K-token re-writes inside one 8-round turn, with the older
prefix resurfacing when a request bounced back to the first key).

The fix is conversation affinity: keep a conversation pinned to the key that
last served it, so its prompt-cache prefix keeps getting hit across rounds.
Affinity is a *soft* preference, not a hard pin — if the sticky key is cooled
down (429), excluded, disabled, or otherwise ineligible, the picker silently
falls back to score-based selection and records the new key as sticky.  This
preserves automatic failover and load-spreading onto healthy keys.

Mechanism
---------
Two pieces, mirroring :mod:`lib.llm_dispatch.provider_pin`:

1. A :class:`threading.local` carrying the *current* conversation id.
   ``run_task`` (the orchestrator's per-task worker thread) sets it from
   ``task['convId']`` and clears it on exit (worker threads are pooled and
   reused).  Aux LLM calls on the same thread (compaction summaries, endpoint
   replan turns) inherit it automatically.

2. A process-global ``conv_id → (key_name, ts)`` recency map.  ``_pick``
   records the chosen key here every pick and reads it back next round.  The
   map persists across turns (each turn is a fresh task/thread for the same
   ``convId``), so a follow-up message reuses the prior turn's key while its
   cache is still warm.  Entries older than the TTL are pruned lazily; the map
   is also size-capped to bound memory on a long-lived server.

Disable with ``TOFU_CONV_STICKY_ROUTING=0``.  Tune staleness with
``TOFU_CONV_STICKY_TTL`` (seconds, default 1800).
