"""lib/llm_dispatch/provider_face.py — the account/face separation.

ONE provider entry describes ONE ACCOUNT. An account has:

  * credentials + policy — ``api_keys``, ``extra_headers``, billing, quota.
    Cardinality 1. This is what "a provider" means to a user.
  * one or more WIRE FACES — a ``(base_url, protocol)`` pair. Cardinality N.

Historically ``base_url`` and ``protocol`` lived only at the provider level,
so an account with two faces was inexpressible and had to be duplicated into
two provider cards sharing one set of keys. The aigc.sankuai.com gateway is
exactly that shape: ``/v1/openai/native`` (OpenAI Chat Completions) and
``/v1/anthropic`` (Anthropic Messages), same account, same keys. The
duplication was never a design choice — it was the only writable shape.

A provider now declares its alternates::

    {
      "base_url": "https://aigc.sankuai.com/v1/openai/native",   # default face
      "faces": {
        "anthropic": {"base_url": "https://aigc.sankuai.com/v1/anthropic",
                      "protocol": "anthropic"}
      },
      "models": [ {"model_id": "kimi-k3"},                       # default face
                  {"model_id": "claude-opus-5"} ]                # → anthropic
    }

RESOLUTION ORDER
----------------
1. ``model['face']`` names a face explicitly → use it. The escape hatch, and
   the ONLY way to force a Claude model onto the default face.
2. Claude-family model + the provider declares an anthropic-protocol face →
   that face. Automatic, so a future ``opus-6`` / ``fable-6`` is correct the
   day it is added, with no config edit and no guard to remember.
3. Otherwise → the provider's default ``base_url`` / ``protocol``.

WHY RULE 2 FAILS LOUD INSTEAD OF FALLING BACK
---------------------------------------------
Never silently degrade a Claude model onto a non-Anthropic wire. Measured
2026-07-28 on ``yuju-claude-opus-5-evaDaily``: the OpenAI face streamed 111
chunks / 33 ``reasoning_content`` / **0 signature**, while the Anthropic face
delivered ``signature_delta`` intact. A thinking block replayed WITHOUT its
signature is rejected upstream, so which face a Claude model sits on is a
correctness fact, not a preference.

The concrete path that would re-introduce it: ``_syncFromTemplate`` ADDs every
template entry the provider lacks, but never writes provider-level fields. So
a merged template carrying the Claude roster + one click of "sync from
template" on an OLD card with no ``faces{}`` would land the whole roster on
the OpenAI face. Refusing to build those slots makes the breakage VISIBLE (the
model is missing and the log says why) instead of invisible (the model works
but its reasoning is silently unusable).

The refusal is HOST-SCOPED, and the host set is DERIVED from the shipped
templates rather than hand-listed — Bedrock, OpenRouter, shubiaobiao and
yeysai all legitimately serve Claude over OpenAI-compatible endpoints and
expose no Anthropic face; on those hosts the OpenAI wire is the only option
and refusing it would outlaw working configurations.
