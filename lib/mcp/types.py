# Double-underscore avoids collision with single-underscore in tool names.

MCP_MAX_RESULT_CHARS = 200_000  # truncate tool results beyond this

# ── Auto-recovery / keepalive ──
# A background loop pings every connected server this often (seconds) and
# transparently reconnects any whose transport has died — so idle-dropped
# connections self-heal without user intervention. Set
# TOFU_MCP_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL=0 to disable the proactive loop (the reactive
# reconnect-on-call path still applies). MCP_PING_TIMEOUT bounds each ping.

# ── Circuit breaker (stop hammering a permanently-broken server) ──
# Backoff applies only AFTER a reconnect attempt fails, so a transient drop
# still heals on the very next keepalive sweep. Once reconnects keep failing,
# the next attempt is gated by an exponentially growing delay:
#   delay = min(BASE * 2**(consecutive_failures - 1), MAX)
# A permanently-broken server therefore converges to one retry per MAX
# seconds (default 10 min) instead of every sweep — but never gives up, so it
# self-heals if the server eventually comes back. A successful reconnect (or
# manual reconnect) resets the breaker.

MCP_BREAKER_MAX_BACKOFF = int(os.environ.get('TOFU_MCP_BREAKER_MAX_BACKOFF', '600'))

# ── Call-level health gating (stop paying full-timeout calls to a stalled server) ──
# The circuit breaker above only covers RECONNECT failures. A server whose
# transport is alive but whose calls keep timing out (e.g. a long-poll tool
# whose own budget exceeds MCP_CALL_TIMEOUT) would otherwise be hammered with
# back-to-back full-timeout calls forever. After this many CONSECUTIVE call
# timeouts a server is marked 'degraded' and the next call fast-fails with an
# actionable error instead of blocking for the full timeout again. Any single
# successful call resets the streak. Set to 0 to disable the gate.
MCP_DEGRADED_TIMEOUT_STREAK = int(os.environ.get('TOFU_MCP_DEGRADED_TIMEOUT_STREAK', '3'))

# ── Credential health probe (detect expired cookies/tokens quietly) ──
# Transport health (a live subprocess + a successful protocol ping) does NOT
# imply the server's stored CREDENTIALS are still valid — an Overleaf session
# cookie expires (~30 days) while the subprocess stays happily connected, so
# every real tool call returns an auth-error string. To surface that in the
# settings panel WITHOUT a user action, a server whose catalog entry declares a
# read-only ``health_probe`` tool is probed once on connect and then every
# MCP_CRED_PROBE_INTERVAL seconds by the keepalive loop; the probe result text
# is classified against the entry's ``fail_patterns`` into ok / expired. Set to
# 0 to disable the periodic probe (the connect-time probe still runs).
MCP_CRED_PROBE_INTERVAL = int(os.environ.get('TOFU_MCP_CRED_PROBE_INTERVAL', '900'))
