"""lib/message_queue.py — Unified priority turn-source queue for conversations.

The queue holds the *sources* of upcoming conversation turns, ordered by
priority.  Three kinds of source share one table:

  • ``real``          — a human message (highest priority).
  • ``workflow_step`` — a turn injected by an orchestration workflow
                        (medium priority; reserved for the workflow engine).
  • ``autopilot``     — a persistent armed-marker sentinel (lowest priority).

``real`` / ``workflow_step`` rows are *dispatchable*: when the active task
finishes, the highest-priority dispatchable row is dequeued and started as a
new task.  The ``autopilot`` row is NOT dispatched as a task — it is a flag
that the end-of-turn autopilot hook (:mod:`lib.tasks_pkg.autopilot`) consults
to decide whether the virtual user should take over.  It stays in the queue
(surviving page reloads) until the VU emits ``[VU: TASK_DONE]`` or the user
cancels it.

Because a human ``real`` row sorts ahead of the ``autopilot`` sentinel, a
message the user types while autopilot is armed is ALWAYS processed first;
autopilot only resumes once no dispatchable row remains.

This replaces the frontend-only ``pendingMessageQueue`` Map that was lost
on page refresh.
