"""lib/message_queue.py — Unified priority turn-source queue for conversations.

The queue holds the *sources* of upcoming conversation turns, ordered by
priority.  Three kinds of source share one table:

  • ``real``          — a human message (highest priority).
  • ``workflow_step`` — a turn injected by an orchestration workflow
                        (medium priority; reserved for the workflow engine).
  • ``autopilot``     — a persistent armed-marker sentinel (lowest priority).

``real`` / ``workflow_step`` rows are *dispatchable*: when the active task
finishes, the highest-priority dispatchable row is dequeued and started as a
new task.  The ``autopilot`` row is NOT dispatched as a task — it is a flag
that the end-of-turn autopilot hook (:mod:`lib.tasks_pkg.autopilot`) consults
to decide whether the virtual user should take over.  It stays in the queue
(surviving page reloads) until the VU emits ``[VU: TASK_DONE]`` or the user
cancels it.

Because a human ``real`` row sorts ahead of the ``autopilot`` sentinel, a
message the user types while autopilot is armed is ALWAYS processed first;
autopilot only resumes once no dispatchable row remains.

This replaces the frontend-only ``pendingMessageQueue`` Map that was lost
on page refresh.

Dispatch durability (pt_4ab943fa): dequeue LEASES a row
(``leased_until``/``lease_task_id``) instead of deleting it. The delete lands
only after ``spawn_task`` succeeds; every failure path releases the lease; a
reaper (:func:`reap_expired_queue_leases`, riding the manager maintenance
tick) reclaims rows whose lease expired without a live task in the registry
and re-dispatches them. A crash or exception mid-dispatch therefore triggers
an automatic retry instead of silently losing the queued message.

    """Re-dispatch every queued turn stranded by a server restart.

    A message enqueued while a task was running lives ONLY in ``message_queue``
    (never in ``conversations.messages`` — deliberate, so it doesn't render
    mid-stream). The queue row is durable, but the ONLY things that drain it are
    the post-task-completion hook, a human send, and the Project-Brain idle
    drain — NONE of which fire on a fresh boot for a conversation with no live
    task. So without this scan, a restart leaves the message shown in the queue
    bar but never processed, with no trace in the transcript = total loss (the
    ``KIND_REAL`` analogue of the autopilot armed-marker gap that
    :func:`~lib.tasks_pkg.autopilot.resume_armed_autopilot_after_crash` closes).

    For each conversation with a dispatchable row, we dispatch ONE task via the
    SAME :func:`dispatch_next_queued` seam every other caller uses — which pops
    the highest-priority queued row, appends its user message to
    ``conversations.messages`` (giving it a durable transcript home at last) and
    spawns the task. We deliberately start only ONE task per conv (not the whole
    queue) — the normal post-task-completion hook drains the remaining rows in
    priority order, exactly as in steady-state operation where a conversation
    only ever has one task running at a time.

    Ordering / safety:
      • Runs at startup AFTER ``recover_stale_tasks_on_startup`` has marked all
        crashed tasks ``interrupted`` and cleared dead ``activeTaskId`` pointers,
        so no conversation has a live in-memory task — draining cannot
        double-dispatch. A defensive live-task guard is applied per conv anyway.
      • ``dispatch_next_queued`` takes the non-reentrant ``_dispatch_lock``
        itself, so we must NOT hold it here.
      • Best-effort per conv: one failure never aborts the batch.

    analogue of :func:`redispatch_orphaned_queue_on_startup`.

    THE Symptom-A root fix. A ``KIND_PEER_MSG`` row that lands in an IDLE
    conversation (no live task, and not the owner of a board epic the workflow
    idle-drain would reconcile) is drained by nothing in steady state — so an
    advisory peer note to an idle sibling is shown ONLY as a pending item in the
    queue widget and never rendered as a turn. This pass, run on the existing
    brain 30s heartbeat (NO new thread/global), drains ONE such row per idle
    conv via the SAME ``dispatch_next_queued`` seam every other caller uses —
    which appends the peer turn to ``conversations.messages`` (giving it the
    ``.peer-msg-banner`` fresh-turn rendering) and spawns a task to answer it.

    This is a deliberate, backend-owned dispatch of a DURABLE, RATE-CAPPED,
    explicitly-sent signal — NOT the frontend age-heuristic auto-fire
    anti-pattern (Case-E). The per-(sender,target) send-time rate cap bounds how
    many peer rows can ever exist; the busy-guard + one-drain-per-conv-per-tick
    bound the work this pass starts.

    Safety (mirrors ``redispatch_orphaned_queue_on_startup``):
      • Skip a conv that has a live non-aborted task — a live drain-eligible
        turn already receives the fast-path inbox twin (delivered at its next
        round boundary), and its completion hook drains the durable row anyway;
        force-draining would double-dispatch. A conv with a live endpoint/VU
        task is likewise "busy" so it keeps queue-lane (cycle-end) delivery.
      • Skip a conv whose row is absent (a concurrent drain already popped it).
      • ``dispatch_next_queued`` takes the non-reentrant ``_dispatch_lock``
        itself, so we must NOT hold it here.
      • Best-effort per conv: one failure never aborts the batch.

# applied the board re-check while the autopilot side counted rows with a

# away a completed 24-round VU turn) and as "discard me" to the dispatcher
# (which spawned nothing). Two correct-looking gates, opposite verdicts on the
# SAME row, and the conversation died with no signal.

# Narrowing the kind check alone would have fixed that ONE instance and left
# the cause: every future filter would again land on only one side. Adding a
# filter HERE moves both readers at once — that is the entire point.
