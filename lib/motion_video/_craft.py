"""lib/motion_video/_craft.py — the deep craft corpus, reachable from the author.

**The dead instruction** (epic pt_db5602172ac44b11 item ③, measured 2026-07-29).
``guide/WORKFLOW.md`` told the author *"Activate `hyperframes-motion` when a
scene needs real choreography"* — but ``activate_skill`` is a CHAT-agent tool,
and the headless per-scene author's toolset is a fixed five
(``write_composition`` / ``composition_check`` / ``web_search`` /
``generate_asset`` / ``fetch_url``). Measured: skill/blueprint hits in
``_scene_author.py`` = **0**. So the sentence pointed at a capability the
engine path could not reach, and every film was authored from the ~20 KB
distilled guide alone while 29 atomic motion rules and 13 multi-phase
blueprints sat in a catalog entry nobody had installed.

**Why this is a managed asset, not a Settings → Skills install.** The skills
catalog is a USER channel: install is a human action, and
``lib.skills.registry.list_skills()`` measured **[]** on this host. A tool that
reads *installed* packages would therefore be dead on exactly the machine that
needs it. The motion pipeline already self-provisions everything it depends on
— the pinned HyperFrames CLI (:func:`lib.motion_video._env.ensure_hyperframes`)
and the CJK sans face (:func:`lib.motion_video._fonts.ensure_cjk_sans`) — so
the craft corpus rides the SAME contract: fetched once into the managed motion
root, then read locally forever. The URL is not re-typed here; it is imported
from the catalog entry so the two can never drift.

**Progressive disclosure is the whole design.** The corpus is 104 KB across
104 files. Injecting it would blow the per-scene budget and drown the beat's
own art direction. Instead the author gets two narrow reads:

  * ``craft_index()`` — the rules/blueprints INDEX (name + one-line summary +
    tags), ~6 KB, cheap enough to hand over with the prompt;
  * ``craft_reference(name)`` — ONE rule or blueprint in full, on demand.

That mirrors how the chat agent uses ``activate_skill`` (index every turn →
full text on match) without borrowing a tool the engine cannot call.

Never fatal: an unreachable network leaves the corpus absent and every
function degrades to empty, so a film still authors from the in-tree guide.
