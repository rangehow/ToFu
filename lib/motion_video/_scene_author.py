"""lib/motion_video/_scene_author.py — Per-scene composition author (P5).

The quality jump over the zero-LLM slide template
(docs/PRODUCTION_PIPELINE_DESIGN.md §2.2 stage 5): each scene gets its OWN
bounded agent loop that writes a bespoke ``index.html`` composition, instead
of every scene rendering as "gradient background + one centred line".

Design constraints (all deliberate):

  * **Narrow toolset.** The author sees only ``write_composition`` (the HTML
    is returned as an argument — there is deliberately no filesystem write
    tool, so a composition can never reference a local asset path),
    ``web_search`` / ``fetch_url`` (for real logos / reference material, which
    are pasted in as INLINE SVG markup), and ``composition_check``.
    It CANNOT render — rendering stays in the engine's render stage, so an
    author loop can never burn a 35s render per iteration.
  * **Per-scene isolation.** Context is one scene's text + duration + the
    composition contract. No whole-film context, so cost is linear and a
    scene's failure is local.
  * **Never fail the film.** Any failure (no composition written, gate still
    failing, token budget exhausted, LLM error, abort) degrades that ONE scene
    to :func:`lib.motion_video._template.render_scene_html`. The caller always
    gets valid HTML back.
  * **Hard cost caps** (owner 拍板 #3): ``max_rounds`` bounds the loop and
    ``token_budget`` stops it once cumulative tokens for THIS scene exceed the
    budget. There is no money cap here — that belongs to the wallet layer.

Default ON (owner 2026-07-27). The zero-LLM template cannot pass the
renderer's own lint and reads as "text flying around with no formatting", so
it is the FALLBACK, never the default deliverable. A job opts OUT per-job
(``task['scene_author'] = False``) or globally via
``TOFU_MOTION_SCENE_AUTHOR=0`` (the emergency kill switch — authoring spends
one agent loop per scene).

    """Author one scene's composition with a bounded agent loop.

    ``max_rounds`` / ``token_budget`` accept ``None`` meaning "use this
    module's default", and that is the ONLY way a caller should express
    "no preference". They used to carry the literals as defaults, so every
    call site wrote its own copy — measured 2026-07-29: ``_DEFAULT_TOKEN_BUDGET``
    was deliberately raised 60000 → 90000 after two scenes were cut off
    mid-repair, but ``engine.py`` and ``routes/api_v1/motion.py`` both passed
    ``or 60000`` explicitly, so the raise was DEAD on every production path and
    the reading-mode panel (which passes neither knob) was silently capped at
    the old ceiling. This is the same failure ``scene_author_enabled``'s
    docstring warns about: a per-caller default is a copy that stops matching.

    Returns ``{'ok', 'html', 'mode', 'rounds', 'tokens', 'detail'}`` where
    ``mode`` is ``'authored'`` (the agent's composition passed the static gate)
    or ``'template'`` (degraded — ``html`` is the zero-LLM template). NEVER
    raises: every failure path degrades, so one bad scene cannot take down the
    film.

    **Transient faults are retried, not degraded** (owner 2026-07-28). Measured
    on the shipped 0-of-8 job: half its scenes degraded for reasons that said
    nothing about composition quality — an expired OAuth token, a 429 from the
    shared gateway, and a 119s read timeout. Each cost that scene its creative
    work permanently, because the engine then wrote the fallback card to
    ``index.html`` and the resume path (which compares only ``data-duration``)
    cannot tell a fallback card from an authored composition, pinning the scene
    to the gradient card for every future run.

    So: an infrastructure fault gets ``transient_attempts`` tries with
    exponential backoff, and whatever the author already wrote is persisted as
    a DRAFT (:func:`save_draft`) and fed back in on the next attempt or the
    next run. Only a genuine quality verdict — a composition that exists and
    still fails the gate — degrades to the template.
