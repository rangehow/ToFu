# Motion Craft — how to make a scene LOOK designed

## 0. The one rule that matters

**A centred line of text on a gradient is not a design.** It is the zero-LLM
fallback. If your composition has exactly one text element and one background,
you have not authored a scene — you have retyped the template. Every scene
needs at least: a **hierarchy** (2+ type sizes with different roles), a
**staged reveal** (elements arrive at different times, not all at 0.2s), and
one **supporting graphic** (rule, shape, bar, icon, number, or divider).

## 1. Pick an archetype from the copy, then hold it

Read the narration and choose ONE. Mixing archetypes inside a film reads as
inconsistent; holding one reads as art-directed.

| The beat is… | Archetype | Build it from |
|---|---|---|
| A number / measurement | **Stat card** | Big tabular number + unit + label + bar or ring |
| Two things contrasted | **Split frame** | Two columns, opposing entrances, a divider |
| A claim / hook / punchline | **Kinetic type** | 2-4 short phrases on a shared beat, distinct entrances |
| A process / sequence | **Step chain** | Numbered rows revealed in order, connector line |
| A definition / concept | **Label + subject** | Centre subject, eyebrow label above, caption below |
| A named product/brand | **Lockup** | Inline SVG logo + wordmark, settle then breathe |
| A list of facts | **Stacked rows** | Left-aligned rows, staggered slide-in, hairline rules |
| Silence / transition | **Hold card** | Minimal mark, slow drift — earn the pause |

## 2. Typography hierarchy (the single biggest quality lever)

Three roles, three sizes, never two of the same:

- **Eyebrow / label** — 28-36px, weight 600, `letter-spacing: 2-6px`,
  60% opacity. Sets context in one or two words.
- **Headline** — the hero. 76-132px, weight 800, `letter-spacing: -1 to -2px`
  (tight tracking is what makes big type look designed), `line-height: 1.1-1.25`.
- **Caption / support** — 34-44px, weight 400-500, 75% opacity,
  `line-height: 1.5`.

Rules of thumb:
- **Contrast ratio between levels ≥ 2×.** 120px next to 96px reads as a
  mistake; 120px next to 40px reads as intent.
- **Never centre everything.** Left-aligned copy with a generous left margin
  looks more designed than centred copy, except for single-line hero cards.
- **Numbers use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums`** or they jitter while
  counting.
- **One accent colour, used once.** Everything else is white at 3 opacities.

### Fonts — a hard host constraint (verified, do not "fix")

The renderer auto-resolves ONLY: `Inter`, `Roboto`, `Open Sans`, `Lato`,
`Montserrat`, `Poppins`, `Source Sans 3`, `Noto Sans`, `Noto Sans JP`.

**Naming any other family does not get you that family** — it silently falls
back to whatever fontconfig has, and `lint` flags it. There is **no auto-resolved
Simplified-Chinese face**, so CJK is served by the host's fontconfig fallback.
Therefore:

- Latin/display: name `Inter` (or another listed family) and stop.
- **CJK: do NOT name `PingFang SC` / `Noto Sans CJK SC` / `Microsoft YaHei`.**
  Let it fall back. Naming them adds a lint error and changes nothing.
- Expect CJK to render in whatever face the host provides — on this host that
  is a **serif**. So do not build a design whose identity depends on a
  geometric sans for Chinese text; carry identity with layout, colour,
  weight and decoration instead.

## 3. Motion — stage it, don't dump it

**Everything arriving at once is the amateur tell.** Give each element its own
entrance offset:

```js
tl.from('#eyebrow',  { opacity: 0, y: 20, duration: 0.5 }, 0.10);
tl.from('#headline', { opacity: 0, y: 56, duration: 0.7, ease: 'power3.out' }, 0.30);
tl.from('#rule',     { scaleX: 0, transformOrigin: 'left center',
                       duration: 0.6, ease: 'power2.out' }, 0.55);
tl.from('.row',      { opacity: 0, x: -32, duration: 0.5,
                       stagger: 0.12 }, 0.70);
```

- **Stagger sibling elements** (`stagger: 0.08-0.15`). This one property does
  more for perceived quality than any other.
- **Eases carry tone.** `power3.out` = confident arrival; `back.out(1.7)` =
  playful pop; `power2.inOut` = calm; linear = broken.
- **Entrances 0.5-0.8s.** Faster reads as a glitch, slower as a drag.
- **Fill the full duration.** After the last element lands, add a slow drift
  (`scale: 1 → 1.03` over the remaining seconds) so the frame is never frozen.
  Compute finite repeats: `repeat: Math.max(0, Math.floor(dur / cycle) - 1)`.
- **Animate transforms + opacity only** — never `width`/`height`/`display`.
  Substitute uniform `scale` for size changes.

### Composable motion recipes (distilled)

- **Count-up** — tween a numeric proxy, `Math.round` in `onUpdate`; grow font
  size with the value for escalating emphasis.
- **Bar grow** — `transform: scaleY(0) → 1` with
  `transform-origin: bottom center` (grow from the baseline, not the middle),
  staggered; accent the final bar.
- **Progress ring** — SVG circle, measure with `getTotalLength()`, tween
  `stroke-dashoffset` → 0, rotate the stroke `-90deg` so it starts at 12 o'clock.
- **Rule / underline draw** — `scaleX: 0 → 1` with
  `transform-origin: left center`.
- **Icon draw** — `stroke-dasharray`/`stroke-dashoffset` from `getTotalLength()`.
- **Beat slam** — one shared beat array, DISTINCT entrance per phrase
  (scale-slam / side-snap / rise-rotate), then a locked finale.
- **Split tilt** — two cards with opposing `rotationY`, entering from their own
  sides, idling in phase opposition.
- **Breathe / idle** — `sine.inOut` yoyo with a finite repeat count.
- **Camera push** — transform ONE wrapper holding all content:
  `translate(x,y) scale(S)`, counter-translate `T = -offset × S`.
- **Morph swap** — outgoing cluster shrinks + fades while incoming pops with
  `back.out(2)` at the same screen centre.

## 4. Layout & colour

- **Compose with padding/flex/grid.** `position: absolute` is for layers and
  decoratives, not main content.
- **Generous margins**: ≥ 80px from frame edges on a 1080px-wide frame. Cramped
  edges are the second amateur tell.
- **Background is a full-bleed child** (`position:absolute; inset:0`), never on
  the composition root — the compositor can drop the root's own background.
- **Depth without clutter**: a large soft radial glow behind the subject, a
  hairline (1-2px, 12% white) divider, a subtle vignette. Not drop shadows on
  everything.
- **Colour**: one dark base + one accent. Deep blue/near-black bases read
  premium; the accent appears on exactly one element (a number, a bar, a word).
- **Contrast is gated** — body text must clear WCAG or `validate` fails. Keep
  support text ≥ 70% opacity on dark backgrounds.
- **Overshooting decoratives** (`yoyo`, `back.out`) need clearance at PEAK
  size, away from `overflow:hidden` edges — `inspect` catches spill.

## 5. Before you finish

Run `composition_check`. It runs the same three gates the renderer runs
(`lint` = contract + fonts, `validate` = headless-Chrome runtime errors +
contrast, `inspect` = text spilling its container across timeline samples).
Fix every finding — each comes with a hint. A green gate is the floor, not the
goal: re-read §0 and confirm you have hierarchy, stagger and a supporting
graphic before you stop.
