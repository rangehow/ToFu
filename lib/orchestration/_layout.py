"""lib/orchestration/_layout.py — Canvas layout (backend-owned positioning).

The frontend is a thin renderer, so a definition's node coordinates are

    The frontend is a thin renderer, so position computation lives here.
    Layers are derived by relaxing ``layer[v] = max(layer[u]+1)`` over
    every edge, bounded by ``len(nodes)`` passes so a cycle (e.g. an
    endpoint loop's critic→loop back-edge) can't spin forever. Nodes are
    then spread horizontally within their layer.

    Mutates each node's ``pos`` in place and returns the same dict for
    chaining. Nodes already carrying a plausible ``pos`` are repositioned
    too (the LLM rarely supplies good coordinates).
