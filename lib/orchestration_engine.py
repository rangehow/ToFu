"""lib/orchestration_engine.py — Execute a tofu.orchestration/v1 graph.

This is the long-missing executor: it interprets a *validated* definition
(role nodes + control nodes + edges) and actually runs the agents, in the
topology the graph describes. It is the piece that finally unifies the two
hand-built orchestrators — endpoint mode (loop + verifier) and the swarm
(fan-out) — under one declarative engine.

Architecture
------------
The engine is a **graph interpreter**. It walks forward from the ``start``
node; agent execution is abstracted behind a single injectable
``agent_runner(node, context, iteration) -> {output, status, error}``.

  * Default runner builds a :class:`SubTaskSpec` + :class:`SubAgent` from
    the swarm substrate (``lib/swarm``) and runs it — same agents the
    swarm uses, with the same role→tool scoping + model tiers.
  * Tests inject a mock runner, so the interpreter (the part with the
    real logic + the loop/fan-out/branch control flow) is fully covered
    in CI without any LLM call.

Supported control semantics (v1)
--------------------------------
  start    — entry; single outgoing edge.
  role     — run an agent; single outgoing edge; output appended to context.
  parallel — every outgoing edge is a branch; branches run concurrently
             (thread pool) and re-converge at their common ``barrier``.
  barrier  — join marker; single outgoing edge.
  loop     — two outgoing edges: a *body* entry (a path that loops back to
             the loop node) and an *exit*. The body runs repeatedly until a
             verifier verdict says STOP or ``max_iterations`` is hit; then
             the exit edge is taken. This IS endpoint mode expressed as data.
  branch   — picks ONE outgoing edge (v1: the first; a future classifier
             agent will choose). Documented limitation.
  stop     — terminal; returns the converged result.

Safety: total agent runs are capped (``max_agents``) and every loop has a
hard ``max_iterations`` cap, so a malformed graph can never spin forever.
