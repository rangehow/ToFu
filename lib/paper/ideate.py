"""lib/paper/ideate.py — breakthrough-idea discovery + anti-"A+B" gate (R3).

The auto-research recipe's stage 4 (docs/AUTO_RESEARCH_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md §3 阶段 4)
and its intellectual core: turn R2's library-verified open-gap map into
**genuinely novel** research ideas, and — the hard part — KILL the "A+B stitching"
ideas that a plain LLM produces by the dozen.

The gate is what makes this not a toy. It runs three passes on every idea, in
cost order (free structural checks first, LLM judging last):

  Gate ① — zero-LLM structural gate (:func:`_structural_gate`)
    Required fields non-empty (linked_gap_id / why_not_AB / core_mechanism /
    falsifiable_prediction / kind), and — the load-bearing rule — the idea's
    ``linked_gap_id`` MUST hit a real ``open_gaps[].id`` from R2. An idea that
    solves no library-verified gap is invalid: it invented its own problem, and
    a problem nobody has is exactly where A+B stitching hides. (Owner pin #2.)

  Gate ② — forced-neighbor-retrieval novelty (:func:`_novelty_prior_set`)
    Owner pin #1: **novelty is measured against a RETRIEVED neighbor set, not
    against what the model chose to cite.** Before judging, we ALWAYS run
    ``search_arxiv`` on a SANITIZED term query (never the mechanism prose —
    that returned 0/25 on-topic neighbours in production and one HTTP 500) and
    pull the top-K into the basis. The retrieved set and the model's
    self-reported prior_art are kept in SEPARATE fields and never merged: they
    have different provenance and different trustworthiness. The judge compares
    the mechanism against the CLOSEST retrieved paper and must label the delta
    mechanism-level vs parameter-level; a parameter-level delta (new dataset /
    new backbone / two modules glued) caps the novelty axis. When retrieval
    yields nothing the basis is ``none`` and the idea CANNOT be accepted — pin
    #1 does not hold, so a rubric score is not evidence of novelty.

  Gate ③ — four-axis rubric (:func:`_score_idea`, mirrors insight `_rubric`)
    novelty / falsifiability / mechanism_depth / value, each 1-5, mean must
    clear ``IDEATE_GATE_THRESHOLD`` (a single tunable constant, initial 4.0 to
    match insight — 宁缺毋滥). Grounding (recommend engine) strips ideas whose
    novelty rests on a hallucinated paper.

Every rejected idea — with its four-axis scores and the reason from EACH gate —
is preserved in the result's ``rejected`` list (and persisted under the
``ideate:<lang>`` report key) so the threshold can be calibrated from real
rejection distributions rather than guessed. (Owner requirement.)

Seams (facade discipline, same as survey/insight): ``dispatch_stream``,
``search_arxiv``, ``fetch_arxiv_title`` are resolved THROUGH this module so a
test patches ``ideate.search_arxiv`` etc. and it bites every gate — the whole
thing is testable with zero network and zero real LLM.
