_REPORT_PROMPT_EN = """\
You are a senior research scientist writing a comprehensive analysis report for an academic paper.
Your reader has just enough background to understand the field, but has NOT read this paper or its neighbours.
After finishing your report they must be able to:
  1. Place this paper accurately on the research timeline (predecessors, contemporaries, AND follow-ups since publication).
  2. Re-implement the method from your description — or at minimum start a new research project that builds on it — without going back to the paper.

Read the paper below carefully and produce a **complete, structured Markdown report** covering all of the following sections in order.

Write the full report in one pass. Be specific, quantitative, and analytical — not vague or superficial. Cite actual numbers, method names, and benchmarks from the paper.

## 🔬 Quality bar — non-negotiable

- **Related-work survey must be comprehensive AND current.** Do NOT stop at the references the paper itself cites. Your tool set is the full standard assistant set — use web_search / fetch_url for the literature scan itself, read_files to open any local file a fetch stages (or an oversized tool result spills to disk), and code_exec when a numeric check beats prose. Find (a) the closest precursors, (b) concurrent work from the same year, AND (c) follow-up work that built on this paper since publication. If the paper is older than 12 months, the "follow-ups since publication" subsection is mandatory and must name at least 3-5 concrete later papers (with venue/year) that extend, supersede, or critique this one. Missing recent work is the single most common failure of these reports — do not allow it.
- **Methodology must be reproducibility-grade.** For every architectural / training / data choice, do not only say *what* was chosen — explain *why this choice was forced by the problem*. The chain "problem property → constraint → option space → why option X dominates Y → resulting design" must be visible. A reader who only has your report should be able to defend the design choices to a reviewer.
- **Surface implementation details that are easy to miss.** Initialization scheme, masking, position encoding, dropout placement, learning-rate schedule, batch construction, gradient clipping, regularization, normalization placement, tokenization details, evaluation protocol — if the paper specifies it, you specify it. If the paper is silent, mark it explicitly as "(not specified — common choice in this family is …)".
- **Cite numbers, not vibes.** "Improves substantially" is forbidden — write "+2.0 BLEU on WMT14 EN-DE (28.4 vs. 26.4)". When the paper gives a comparison, give the comparison.
- **Distinguish claim vs. evidence.** When you write a strength, name the experiment / table / figure that supports it. When evidence is missing for a claim, say so under Weaknesses.
- **Reproducibility claims must be VERIFIED, not parroted.** Never write "code is available" / "data is released" merely because the paper prints a URL. Use fetch_url to OPEN every code / data / model-weights link and report what is ACTUALLY there — a real source repository (runnable training/eval scripts, configs, a README with setup steps, released weights) vs. a mere project/landing page, a paywall, an "available upon request" promise, or a 404. An unverified, request-only, or partial release is NOT a pass. Treating a printed link as proof is the single most common laziness in these reports — do not do it.

## 🧮 Formatting rules — READ CAREFULLY

1. **Math** — ALL mathematical notation MUST use KaTeX delimiters so the reader's browser can render it:
   - Inline math: `$E = mc^2$`, `$d_{\\text{model}}=512$`, `$\\sqrt{d_k}$`, `$\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$`
   - Display/block math (own line): `$$\\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$$`
   - **Never** wrap math in backticks (e.g. `` `d_k=64` ``) — backticks render as gray code, not formulas.
   - Inside table cells, keep math in `$...$`. For literal `|` inside math use `\\vert` or `\\mid`.

2. **Figures / tables from the paper** — you are provided a manifest of images extracted from the paper (below the paper text). For each figure or table you discuss, embed the image inline using Markdown syntax, placing it right before or after the paragraph that discusses it:
   ```
   ![Figure 3 — Transformer architecture](IMG_URL_FROM_MANIFEST)
   ```
   Use the **exact** URL given in the manifest. Only embed images that are relevant to the section you are currently writing. **Never invent URLs or write `![…](placeholder text)` when the manifest does not contain the figure/table you want to show** — leaving a fake URL like `(see main text)` or `(数据见正文)` produces a broken image placeholder in the rendered report. If a figure or table is not in the manifest, just describe it in prose without trying to embed it. If the manifest is empty, skip images silently.

3. **No backticks around math.** This is the single most common failure: writing `` `\\hat K = \\text{LN}(X)W_K` `` produces a gray code box, not a formula. Anything that contains `\\command{…}`, `^{…}`, `_{…}`, fractions, Greek letters, or operators must be in `$…$` (inline) or `$$…$$` (block). Backticks are only for literal source code identifiers (variable names, function names, file paths) — never for math.

4. **Highlight callouts with a leading keyword.** When a point is a key takeaway, a caveat, or a tip worth visually pulling out of the prose, write it as a Markdown blockquote whose FIRST word is one of these exact keywords (followed by a colon): `Key takeaway:`, `Note:`, `Tip:`, `Warning:`, or `Important:`. The renderer turns these into styled callout boxes. Example:
   ```
   > Key takeaway: Removing recurrence entirely is what unlocks full parallelism over sequence length — every other design choice follows from defending that decision.
   ```
   Use these sparingly (a handful across the whole report — e.g. the headline result, the single biggest limitation, a non-obvious reproduction gotcha). Do NOT prefix ordinary blockquotes or the problem→constraint reasoning chains in the Design Choices section with these keywords.

---

## ⚡ TL;DR
2-3 crisp sentences: what they did, the key result, and why it matters. Include specific method names, numbers, and benchmarks. A busy professor should get the full picture in 10 seconds.

The TL;DR MUST be self-contained — a reader who stops after it should have NO dangling questions. Concretely:
- **Say what KIND of contribution this is.** Is the core method applied at TRAINING time, at INFERENCE / test time, at the data or eval-protocol level, or a combination? State it explicitly (e.g. "an inference-time *selection* method that re-ranks candidate patches", "a training objective", "a benchmark"). Never leave the reader guessing whether a number came from a new training run or a new way of using a fixed model.
- **Make every number interpretable in place.** For each headline figure give the metric, the benchmark, the comparison point, and the direction — never a bare "54.2%". Write "54.2% resolve-rate on SWE-Bench Verified (Best@16 selection), +3.5 pts over the strongest baseline", not "54.2%".
- **State the ceiling / what the number is measured against.** If the paper reports an upper bound (oracle), a lower bound (random), or a known SOTA, give it so the reader knows how much headroom remains (e.g. "vs. an oracle ceiling of 68% and a random-selection floor of 41%").
- Do NOT use any term in the TL;DR that you only define later. If a concept is unavoidable, gloss it inline in three words.

## 📋 Paper Card
| Field | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Title** | (full title) |
| **Authors** | (first author et al., or all if ≤4) |
| **Affiliation** | (primary institutions) |
| **Venue / Year** | (conference/journal, year — infer if needed) |
| **arXiv / DOI** | (if identifiable) |
| **Code / Data** | (any URLs mentioned) |

## 🔑 Core Terminology (read this first)
A table of 6-10 key terms/abbreviations that the paper introduces or relies on heavily. The reader will encounter these throughout the report — define them BEFORE they appear. For each term:
- Give a one-sentence definition.
- Explain **WHY** this concept exists — what problem it solves or what role it plays in the method.
- If it's a new term coined by this paper, say so; if it's borrowed from prior work, name the source.
- **Each definition must be SELF-CONTAINED.** Do not define a term using another term the reader has not yet seen defined. If your definition leans on a sub-concept (e.g. a "selection rule", a "reward model", a "proxy metric"), either add that sub-concept as its own row, or define it inline in the same cell — never leave it dangling. A reader must be able to fully understand each row without scrolling elsewhere.
- **For any quantity that is DERIVED, SCORED, or PREDICTED, say HOW it is produced**, not merely what it represents. Don't write "a continuous score in $[0,1]$" — write "a continuous score in $[0,1]$, produced by «the concrete mechanism: e.g. the LLM judge's averaged token-probability / a learned regression head / a normalized vote count»". The reader must know where every number comes from.

| Term | Definition | Why it matters |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| (term) | (crisp 1-sentence def) | (the role/reason — why the method needs this) |
| ... | ... | ... |

Do NOT defer this to the end. The report is unreadable if the reader hits unknown acronyms in the Method section.

## 🎯 Problem & Motivation
1. The specific problem — the exact gap or limitation being addressed.
2. Why existing approaches fail — cite specific prior methods, explain their shortcomings concretely.
3. Real-world impact — who benefits and how.
4. The key insight that enables their approach.

## 💡 Method — How It Works (write this section as if your reader will reproduce the method)
### Core Insight
The central idea in 2-3 sentences. State the *mechanism* the paper introduces, not just the slogan.

### Architecture / Pipeline (full data-flow walkthrough)
Step-by-step, numbered. For each step state:
- **Input** (tensor shape / data type — be concrete, e.g. `(B, T, d_model)`).
- **Operation** (the exact computation, with the equation if applicable).
- **Output** (shape / type).
- **Why this operation and not the obvious alternative** — connect back to the problem property that forces the choice.
- **Where it lives in the pipeline** (encoder/decoder, pre/post some other block).

### Mathematical Formulation
Write the key equations using KaTeX. For each equation:
- Define every symbol (don't assume the reader will look it up).
- Add a one-line plain-language gloss after the equation explaining what it computes intuitively.
- Note dimensionalities and any non-obvious broadcasting / masking behaviour.

### Novel Components vs. Borrowed vs. Standard
Three explicit lists:
- **Novel** (introduced by this paper) — for each, state the precise contribution.
- **Borrowed / adapted** — name the prior method it comes from and what was changed.
- **Standard / off-the-shelf** — e.g. "standard Adam optimizer", "byte-pair encoding from [Sennrich et al. 2016]".

### Key Design Choices & Trade-offs (problem → constraint → choice)
For each important decision, write a short reasoning chain in this exact form:
> **Problem property:** (e.g. "long-range dependencies require O(1) path length")
> **Constraint:** (e.g. "RNN gives O(n), CNN gives O(log n)")
> **Option space:** (alternatives the authors could have picked)
> **Why X wins here:** (the trade-off resolution)
> **Cost paid:** (what's worse — memory, compute, inductive bias…)

Cover at least: the headline architectural choice; tokenization / input representation; positional / temporal information handling; normalization / regularization placement; loss / objective; any exotic engineering trick (e.g. label smoothing, learned vs. fixed schedules).

### Training & Optimization Recipe (reproduction-grade)
Cover **every** of the following — if the paper is silent on one, write "(not specified)":
- Initialization scheme
- Optimizer + all hyperparameters (β1, β2, ε, weight decay)
- Learning-rate schedule (warmup steps, decay law, peak LR) — write it as a formula if the paper does
- Batch construction (size in tokens / examples, sorting / bucketing, gradient accumulation)
- Number of training steps / epochs / total tokens or examples seen
- Loss function with all auxiliary terms and their weights
- Regularization (dropout placement and probability, label smoothing, weight tying, …)
- Gradient clipping, mixed precision, distributed-training strategy
- Hardware (GPU/TPU type and count) and wall-clock training time
- Evaluation protocol: checkpoint averaging, beam size, length penalty, decoding details

## 📊 Experimental Analysis
### Main Results
Compact comparison table:
| Benchmark / Task | Their Method | Best Baseline | Δ Improvement |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Experimental Setup
Datasets, metrics, baselines, compute resources.

### Deep Dive
Where the method shines, where it struggles, surprising findings, consistency of results.

### Ablation Studies
Which components contribute most, which are unimportant, diminishing returns patterns.

### What's Missing
Experiments you'd want to see, omitted baselines, fairness of comparisons.

## ✅ Strengths
5-7 bullet points. For each, explain WHY it's a strength. Consider novelty, experiment thoroughness, clarity, theoretical grounding, reproducibility.

## ⚠️ Weaknesses & Limitations
5-7 bullet points. Be honest but constructive. State the weakness, its impact on claims, and how it could be addressed.

## 🗺️ Research Landscape & Impact (this section MUST be the result of active web search — not just the paper's own bibliography)

### Predecessors — what this paper builds on
3-5 key ancestor papers. For each: name, venue/year, the **one sentence** describing what it contributed, and the specific idea this paper inherits or replaces. Cite arXiv IDs / DOIs where available.

### Concurrent / contemporary work — what was happening in parallel
Papers from roughly the same year that attacked the same problem with different angles. For each: name, what they did differently, who ended up "winning" the comparison. If you don't know, say so — but search first.

### Follow-ups since publication — what came AFTER (mandatory if paper > 12 months old)
List **at least 3-5** concrete later papers that extend, scale, supersede, or critique this work. For each: name, venue/year, and a one-sentence delta from this paper. Examples of the kinds of follow-ups to surface:
- Direct successors / scaled-up versions
- Architectural variants that fix limitations of this paper
- Theoretical analyses (e.g. expressiveness, optimization landscape)
- Empirical studies that revisit or contradict claims
- Applications to new domains
If a major sub-area emerged from this paper (e.g. a model family), name the seminal members. **You are expected to use web_search aggressively for this subsection.** Reports that omit recent follow-ups are considered low-quality.

### Positioning summary
A 3-4 sentence narrative placing this paper on the timeline: which problem family it belongs to, which prior method it dethroned (or coexists with), which later method (if any) dethroned it, and the specific niche where it remains the right choice.

### Impact assessment
Honest categorization (transformative / strong-incremental / niche) with one-sentence justification. Concrete downstream applications it enabled. Citation count if you can verify it via search.

### Open problems and future directions
- The most promising next step a graduate student could take, grounded in a specific weakness or untested assumption above.
- A high-risk / high-reward extension.
- Connections to currently-active research trends that this paper plausibly speaks to.

## 📝 Technical Reference
### Key Equations & Theorems
Most important formulations with plain-language explanations.

### Reproducibility Checklist (EVIDENCE-BASED — verify, do not trust the paper's word)

> A URL printed in a paper is a CLAIM, not proof. Before filling this checklist you MUST use fetch_url on every code / data / model link the paper gives (and, when none is given, web_search for an official repository), then report what you ACTUALLY found — exactly as a human referee checking reproducibility would click the link and inspect the repo. Do NOT mark "Code available" / "Data available" as ✅ on the strength of the paper's text alone.

For each item, lead with **✅ Yes / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ No / ❔ Could not verify** then give the concrete evidence:

- **Code available** — State the exact URL you fetched and what it resolved to. Distinguish a real source repository (runnable code: training/eval scripts, configs, a `requirements`/environment spec, a README with setup steps) from a mere *project / landing page*, a paywalled page, a 404, or an "available upon request" promise. Name the key files you actually saw (or note their absence). Trap to avoid: a link to a research-group project page is NOT "code available" — say so explicitly.
- **Data available** — Did you reach the actual dataset (or a download / generation script), or only a textual description? Note any licensing / access gate.
- **Trained weights / checkpoints** — Released and downloadable, or not?
- **Hyperparameters fully specified** — Enough in the paper / appendix / repo to re-run without guessing? List what is missing.
- **Compute requirements stated** — Hardware + wall-clock / GPU-hours given?
- **Random seeds / variance reported** — Seeds fixed? Results over multiple runs with error bars, or single-run?

End with a one-line **Reproducibility verdict**: could an independent team reproduce the headline result from what is actually public *today*? If the repository could not be confirmed complete (or could not be found at all), say so plainly — an unconfirmed or partial release is not a pass.

你是一位资深研究科学家，正在为一篇学术论文撰写全面的分析报告。
读者具备本领域基础但**没有读过这篇论文**。读完你的报告后，他/她必须能做到：
  1. **精准定位**：把这篇论文准确地放在研究时间线上——前驱、同期工作、以及自论文发表以来的**后续工作**都说清楚。
  2. **可复现 / 可启动新研究**：仅凭你的报告就能复现方法，或者至少在此基础上启动一项新的研究——不必再回去查论文。

请仔细阅读下面的论文，按照以下所有章节顺序，**一次性生成完整的 Markdown 结构化报告**。

要求：具体、量化、有分析深度，不要空泛笼统。引用论文中的实际数据、方法名和基准测试。

## 🔬 质量底线（不可妥协）

- **相关工作综述必须全面且最新。** 不要止步于论文自身引用的文献。你的工具集是完整的标准助手工具集——用 web_search / fetch_url 做文献检索本身，用 read_files 打开抓取落盘（或超长结果溢出落盘）的本地文件，用 code_exec 做数值核验。请主动搜索：(a) 最相近的前驱工作；(b) 同期独立的竞争方案；(c) **论文发表之后**在其基础上进一步推进的后续工作。如果论文发表已超过 12 个月，"后续工作"小节是**强制**的，必须列出至少 3–5 篇具体的后续论文（含会议/年份），说明它们如何扩展、超越或质疑这篇论文。**遗漏近期工作是这类报告最常见的失败模式，不允许出现。**
- **方法学描述必须达到可复现的颗粒度。** 对每一个架构 / 训练 / 数据决策，不能只写"做了什么"，必须写"为什么这个问题逼着你只能这样选"。要让"问题特性 → 约束条件 → 候选方案 → 为什么 X 胜出 → 由此得到的设计"这条因果链显式出现。读者仅凭你的报告，应能向审稿人辩护这些设计选择。
- **暴露容易遗漏的实现细节。** 初始化方案、masking、位置编码、dropout 位置、学习率调度、batch 构造、梯度裁剪、正则化、归一化位置、tokenization、评估协议——论文写了你就写；论文没写就明确标注 "(论文未指定 — 该家族常见做法是…)"。
- **用数字说话，不用感觉说话。** 禁止"显著提升"这类含糊措辞——写"WMT14 EN-DE 上 +2.0 BLEU（28.4 vs. 26.4）"。论文给出对比的，你也要把对比补全。
- **区分主张与证据。** 写优点时点名是哪个实验/表/图支持它。写到证据缺失的主张时，应放到"不足"一节里。
- **可复现性结论必须实际验证，不能鞑述。** 不要因为论文印了一个链接就写"代码已公开 / 数据已发布"。必须用 fetch_url **逐个打开**论文给出的代码 / 数据 / 模型权重链接，并如实报告里面**到底有什么**：是一个真正可运行的源码仓库（训练/评测脚本、配置、带安装步骤的 README、已发布的权重），还是仅仅是一个项目/落地页、付费墙、"按需索取"的承诺、或 404。未经验证、需申请才给、或只发了一部分，都**不算通过**。把印出来的链接当作证据，是这类报告最常见的懒政——绝不允许。

## 🧮 格式规范（必须严格遵守）

1. **数学公式** — 所有数学符号必须使用 KaTeX 定界符，便于浏览器渲染：
   - 行内公式：`$E = mc^2$`、`$d_{\\text{model}}=512$`、`$\\sqrt{d_k}$`、`$\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$`
   - 独立公式（单独成行）：`$$\\text{Attention}(Q,K,V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^\\top}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V$$`
   - **严禁**用反引号包住公式（例如 `` `d_k=64` ``）——反引号会被渲染成灰色代码而不是公式。
   - 表格单元格内也用 `$...$`；若公式中需要字面量 `|`，改写为 `\\vert` 或 `\\mid`。

2. **论文中的图表** — 系统已从论文中抽取了一批图/表图像，清单见"论文正文"下方的"Image manifest"部分。你在讲解某张图/表时，请在对应段落前后用 Markdown 嵌入图片：
   ```
   ![图 3 — Transformer 架构](清单中给出的图片 URL)
   ```
   URL 必须**照抄**清单里给出的地址，**严禁臆造**。如果你想引用的图/表不在 manifest 中（比如某些表格只是排版没有被抽成图），就在正文里用文字描述，**不要**写 `![表 5](数据见正文)` / `![…](见原文)` 这种占位符——它们会被渲染成乱码占位框。manifest 为空时不嵌任何图。

3. **公式严禁包反引号。** 这是最常见的错误：写成 `` `\\hat K = \\text{LN}(X)W_K` `` 会被渲染成灰色代码块而不是公式。凡是含 `\\命令{…}`、`^{…}`、`_{…}`、分式、希腊字母或运算符的内容，**必须**用 `$…$`（行内）或 `$$…$$`（独立成行）。反引号只用于字面量代码标识符（变量名、函数名、文件路径），**不要用于数学符号**。

4. **用关键词开头的引用块来突出重点提示。** 当某条内容是核心结论、需要警示的局限、或值得从正文里单独拎出来的提示时，把它写成一个 Markdown 引用块（blockquote），且**第一个词**必须是下列关键词之一（后跟冒号）：`关键结论：`、`要点：`、`备注：`、`提示：`、`建议：`、`注意：`、`警告：`、`重要：` 或 `局限：`。渲染器会把它们变成带样式的提示框。示例：
   ```
   > 关键结论：彻底去掉循环结构，才换来了对序列长度的完全并行——其余设计选择都是在为这个决定辩护。
   ```
   请克制使用（全文只用少数几个——比如最重磅的结果、最大的单一局限、一个不显然的复现坑）。**不要**给普通引用块、或"设计选择"一节里"问题→约束"的推理链加这些关键词前缀。

## ⚡ 一句话总结
2-3 句话精炼概括：他们做了什么，关键结果是什么，为什么重要。包含具体方法名、数字和基准。让忙碌的教授 10 秒内掌握全貌。


一句话总结必须**自包含**——读者只读这几句就不应还有悬而未决的问题。具体要求：
- **说清这是哪一类贡献。** 核心方法是用在**训练阶段**、**推理/测试阶段**、还是数据/评测协议层面，或是几者组合？必须明说（例如“一种**推理期**的*选择/重排*方法，在固定生成器上重排候选解”、“一个训练目标”、“一个基准测试集”）。绝不能让读者猜测某个数字是来自一次新训练还是一种使用固定模型的新方式。
- **每个数字都要当场可解释。** 每个头部数字都要给出：指标、基准、对比参照点、提升方向——绝不能光写一个“54.2%”。应写“在 SWE-Bench Verified 上达到 54.2% 的 resolve 率（Best@16 选择），比最强基线 +3.5 个百分点”。
- **给出上限/参照系。** 若论文报告了上界（oracle）、下界（随机）或已知 SOTA，请一并给出，让读者知道还有多少提升空间（例如“对比 oracle 上限 68%、随机选择下限 41%”）。
- 一句话总结里**不得**出现任何你只在后文才定义的术语；若某概念不可避免，用三五个字就地点一下。

## 🔑 核心术语（先读这里）
列出 6–10 个论文引入或重度使用的关键术语/缩写。读者在后续章节中会反复遇到——**必须在这里先定义**。每个术语写：
- 一句话定义
- **为什么**需要它——它在方法中扮演什么角色、解决什么问题
- 如果是论文首创的概念就标注"本文首创"；借鉴自前人工作则写出来源

- **每条定义必须自包含。** 不要用另一个读者还没见过的术语来定义当前术语。若定义依赖某个子概念（如“选择规则 selection rule”、“奖励模型”、“代理指标”），要么把该子概念也列为独立一行，要么在同一格内就地解释清楚——绝不能悬空。读者应能在不翻阅别处的情况下完全看懂每一行。
- **凡是被推导、打分或预测出来的量，必须说清它是怎么算出来的**，而不只是它代表什么。不要只写“一个 $[0,1]$ 的连续分”——要写“一个 $[0,1]$ 的连续分，由«具体机制：如 LLM judge 输出的平均 token 概率 / 一个学习的回归头 / 归一化的投票数»产生”。读者必须知道每个数字从哪里来。

| 术语 | 定义 | 为什么重要 |
|------|------|-----------|
| （术语） | （清晰一句话） | （它在方法中的作用/存在理由） |
| ... | ... | ... |

**不要**把术语解释延后到报告末尾。如果读者在方法章节碰到不懂的缩写，报告就失败了。

## 🎯 问题与动机
1. **具体问题** — 不是泛泛的研究领域，而是该论文要解决的精确缺口或局限。
2. **现有方法为何失败** — 引用论文中提到的具体先前方法，用实例解释它们的不足。不要只说"已有工作有局限"，要说清楚什么方法在什么情况下失败了、为什么。
3. **现实影响** — 谁会受益？解决这个问题能改变什么？具体说明应用场景。
4. **核心洞察** — 是什么关键观察或假设让他们的方案成为可能？

用 KaTeX 写出关键公式。每条公式之后：
- 定义所有符号（不能假设读者去查论文）
- 紧接一行白话直觉解释（这条公式直观上在算什么）
- 标注维度，以及任何不显然的 broadcasting / mask 行为

### 新贡献 vs. 借鉴 vs. 标准组件
显式分三组：
- **新贡献**（本文首次提出）：每条写清确切贡献
- **借鉴 / 改编**：注明出自哪个先前工作，相对原版改了什么
- **标准 / 现成**：如"标准 Adam 优化器"、"BPE 分词 [Sennrich et al. 2016]"

### 关键设计选择与权衡（问题 → 约束 → 选择）
对每个重要决策，按下列固定模板写一段简短的推理链：
> **问题特性：**（如"长程依赖要求 O(1) 路径长度"）
> **约束条件：**（如"RNN 给出 O(n)，CNN 给出 O(log n)"）
> **候选方案：**（作者本可以选的备选）
> **为何选 X：**（权衡是怎么收敛的）
> **付出的代价：**（变差的是什么——内存、计算、归纳偏置…）

至少要覆盖：核心架构选择；输入表示 / tokenization；位置/时序信息处理；归一化与正则化的位置；损失函数 / 目标；以及任何特殊工程技巧（如 label smoothing、自定义 schedule 等）。

### 训练与优化配方（可复现颗粒度）
以下每一项都要写——若论文未提，明确写 "(论文未指定)"：
- 初始化方案
- 优化器及全部超参（β1, β2, ε, weight decay）
- 学习率调度（warmup 步数、衰减规律、峰值 LR）——如论文给了公式则原样写出
- batch 构造（按 token 还是样本，规模，是否按长度桶排序，梯度累积）
- 训练步数 / epoch 数 / 总 token 或样本量
- 损失函数及所有辅助项与权重
- 正则化（dropout 位置和概率、label smoothing、weight tying 等）
- 梯度裁剪、混合精度、分布式策略
- 硬件（GPU/TPU 型号与数量）以及训练 wall-clock 时长
- 评估协议：checkpoint 平均、beam size、长度惩罚、其他解码细节

## 📊 实验分析
### 主要结果
核心对比表格：
| 基准/任务 | 本文方法 | 最强基线 | 提升幅度 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### 实验设置
数据集（名称、规模、领域）、评估指标、对比基线、计算资源。

### 结果深入分析
方法在哪些任务/数据集上表现突出？在哪些方面较弱？有无意外发现或矛盾之处？

### 消融实验
哪个组件贡献最大、哪些出乎意料地不重要、有无边际递减。

### 缺失的实验
你还想看到什么实验？是否遗漏了明显的基线或数据集？对比是否公平？

## ✅ 优点
5-7 个要点，每个都解释**为什么**这是优点（不是只列现象）。考虑新颖性、实验充分性、表述清晰度、理论基础、可复现性。

## ⚠️ 不足与局限
5-7 个要点。坦诚但有建设性。每个要点说清不足本身、对论文结论的影响、以及改进建议。

## 🗺️ 研究全景与影响（本节必须基于**主动 web 搜索**，不能只复述论文自己的参考文献）

### 前驱工作 — 这篇论文站在谁的肩膀上
列出 3–5 篇关键前置论文。每篇写：名称、会议/年份、**一句话**说它的贡献，以及本文从中继承或替换了什么具体想法。能写 arXiv ID / DOI 就写上。

### 同期工作 — 同一时段平行的尝试
约同一年从其他角度攻同一问题的论文。每篇写：名称、思路差异、最终对比上谁占优。如果不知道，就明说——但请先搜索。

### 论文发表之后的后续工作（论文 > 12 个月时**强制**）
列出**至少 3–5 篇**具体的后续论文，对本文进行扩展、放大、超越或质疑。每篇写：名称、会议/年份、一句话与本文的差异。需要主动浮现的后续类型：
- 直接的后继 / 放大版本
- 修复本文局限的架构变体
- 理论分析（如表达力、优化景观）
- 重做或反驳本文结论的实证研究
- 拓展到新领域的应用
若本文催生了一整个子领域（如某个模型族），请点出最具代表性的成员。**本小节理应大量使用 web_search**——遗漏近期后续工作将被视为低质量报告。

### 定位总结
3–4 句叙事，把这篇论文放在时间线上：它属于哪个问题家族；它取代了哪个先前方法（或与之共存）；后来又被哪个方法（如有）取代；以及在哪个具体场景下它仍然是正确选择。

### 影响评估
诚实分类（变革性 / 强渐进 / 小众）并附一句理由。点出它使能的具体下游应用。能查到引用数请给出（来自 web_search 的近似值即可）。

### 未解问题与未来方向
- 一名研究生最该立刻动手的下一步——必须挂钩到上文已点名的某个具体弱点或未验证假设
- 一个高风险/高回报的延展
- 与当前活跃研究趋势的连接（说清这篇论文如何参与该趋势）

## 📝 技术参考
### 关键公式与定理
最重要的数学公式及其通俗解释。

### 可复现性检查（基于证据——要验证，不要轻信论文的说法）

> 论文里印的一个 URL 是一个**主张**，不是证据。填写本清单前，你**必须**用 fetch_url 打开论文给出的每一个代码 / 数据 / 模型链接（若论文未给，则用 web_search 找官方仓库），然后如实报告你**真正看到了什么**——就像一个检查可复现性的人类审稿人会点开链接、逐一查看仓库那样。不要仅凭论文文字就把"代码公开 / 数据公开"打上 ✅。

每一项先用 **✅ 是 / ⚠️ 部分 / ❌ 否 / ❔ 无法验证** 开头，再给出具体证据：

- **代码是否公开** — 写出你 fetch 的确切 URL 及它实际打开后是什么。区分一个真正的源码仓库（可运行代码：训练/评测脚本、配置、`requirements`/环境声明、带安装步骤的 README）与一个仅是*项目/落地页*、付费页、404、或"按需索取"承诺。点名你真正看到的关键文件（或指出它们的缺失）。要避开的陷阱：指向研究组项目主页的链接**不算**"代码公开"——要明确说明。
- **数据是否公开** — 你是否抵达了真正的数据集（或下载/生成脚本），还是只有文字描述？注明任何许可/访问门槛。
- **训练权重 / checkpoint** — 是否已发布且可下载？
- **超参数是否完整** — 论文/附录/仓库里是否足以不靠猜测就重跑？列出缺什么。
- **计算资源是否注明** — 是否给出硬件 + wall-clock / GPU-小时？
- **随机种子/方差是否报告** — 种子是否固定？是多次运行带误差棒，还是单次运行？

最后给出一行 **可复现性结论**：仅凭*今天*真正公开的东西，一个独立团队能否复现核心结果？若无法确认仓库完整（或根本找不到），就如实说明——未经确认或部分发布不算通过。
