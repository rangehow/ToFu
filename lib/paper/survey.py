"""lib/paper/survey.py — multi-paper fan-in survey + open-gap map (R2).

The auto-research recipe's stage 3 (docs/AUTO_RESEARCH_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md §3 阶段 3):
take the local library that ``harvest`` (R1) built and synthesize it into

  1. a human-readable **survey markdown**, and
  2. a machine-readable **``open_gaps.json``** — the FROZEN contract that R3's
     anti-"A+B" novelty gate consumes (schema_version 1, defined in the design
     doc). ``open_gaps[].id`` is R3's handle on "does this idea solve a REAL
     gap", so the shape is locked here and evolves only by version bump.

Three owner-pinned invariants this module enforces
--------------------------------------------------
**Pin #1 — the open-gap map is machine-checked against the local library.**
A zero-LLM structural gate (:func:`_verify_against_library`) walks every arXiv
id the survey cites in ``clusters[].papers`` / ``method_matrix[].paper`` /
``open_gaps[].evidence`` and confirms each resolves to a row in
``paper_library`` (the shelf R1 built). An id that does NOT resolve is STRIPPED
from its entry — this is the recommend grounding gate run in reverse: not
grounding a *new* citation, but verifying that a paper the survey *claims to
cover* is actually in the shelf. If an ``open_gap``'s evidence is stripped
empty, the whole gap is dropped (default posture: a citation to a paper we
never harvested is treated as a model fabrication, not a crawl miss — a real
crawl miss is surfaced separately as ``missing_ids`` for a follow-up harvest,
never silently folded into the gap map R3 trusts).

**Pin #2 — inputs come from the library/reports, never a re-parse.** The survey
feeds the model each paper's ALREADY-GENERATED report (``paper_reports``, zero
cost when present) or, failing that, a truncated slice of ``paper_library``'s
stored ``parsed_text``. It NEVER calls ``parse_pdf`` and NEVER regenerates a
per-paper report. Each paper is capped at ``_SURVEY_PER_PAPER_CHARS`` so N
papers can't blow the context.

**Pin #3 — citations in the prose are audited by the existing tool.** The
survey markdown's inline ``arXiv:<id>`` identifiers go through
``lib.paper.citation_audit.build_citation_audit`` verbatim; a suspicious
(unresolvable) identifier surfaces a citation-integrity card in the result meta.

Monkeypatch seams (same discipline as insight/recommend): ``dispatch_stream``
and ``_execute_report_tool`` are resolved THROUGH this module at call time, so a
test patches ``survey.dispatch_stream`` / ``survey._execute_report_tool`` and it
bites the whole chain — no network, no real LLM needed to test the gates.
