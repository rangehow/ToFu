"""lib/paper/video_abstract.py — Paper → narrated video abstract (P3).

The motion-video pipeline's paper entry point, sibling to the podcast
chain (report → spoken script → TTS audio): here the report becomes a
short narrated MG video (report → scene beats → motion engine).

Flow:

  1. ``has_report`` gate (same report-first UX as the podcast start route);
  2. source text via the podcast chain's ``_load_source_text`` (report in
     the requested language → other language → translation → parsed text);
  3. :func:`build_abstract_scenes` — beats carrying THREE separate fields
     (see below), each one sized to fit both its frame and its time slot;
  4. the scenes drive the motion engine in scenes-only mode (no SRT —
     loose alignment lets TTS narration stretch each beat to fit);
  5. progress/results ride the motion runtime (poll/file endpoints).

**The three-field scene contract** (owner 2026-07-27). The original
implementation put one paragraph of report prose into ``text`` and let it
serve as narration, on-screen headline AND subtitle at once. That is what
produced 1898-char headlines at 46px on a 1440px frame. A beat now carries:

  * ``text``      — SPOKEN narration (TTS + sidecar SRT), budgeted so it is
                    utterable inside the scene's own duration;
  * ``on_screen`` — the ON-FRAME caption, bounded by the template's measured
                    :func:`~lib.motion_video._template.on_screen_capacity`;
  * ``visual``    — ART DIRECTION for the per-scene author. Untouched
                    semantics: it is NOT drawn as the headline.

**Beats are written, not sliced.** The default path rewrites the report with
an LLM through the SAME script stage the topic recipe uses
(:func:`lib.motion_video._recipe.script_stage_for_source`), so there is one
implementation of "prose → spoken beats" in the tree. Slicing prose on a
character budget is kept ONLY as the zero-LLM fallback
(:func:`slice_abstract_beats`) for when no model is reachable, and its output
must satisfy the same budget as the LLM path.

**No silent clamping.** When a beat's text does not fit its slot the builder
RE-CUTS (splits the beat, or trims the caption) — it never parks the scene on
``_MAX_SCENE_S`` and calls it done. A duration sitting exactly on the ceiling
is a swallowed error, and :func:`lib.motion_video.check_scene_budget` fails
the storyboard for it.
