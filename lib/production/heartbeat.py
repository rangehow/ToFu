"""lib/production/heartbeat.py — worker-side liveness heartbeat (P-UX2).

The third piece of the progress-perception contract
(docs/PAPER_MEDIA_UX_DESIGN.md §3.1): long phases (LLM script writing,
per-scene TTS, concat/mux ffmpeg runs) emit **zero events** today, so the
frontend cannot tell "working" from "dead" — and the read-side stall reaper
(:meth:`TaskRuntime.reap_if_stalled`) would false-kill them.

Usage — wrap any long phase::

    from lib.production.heartbeat import heartbeat

    with heartbeat(task, _append_podcast_event, 'script'):
        script, meta = generate_script(...)

Every ``interval`` seconds a ``{'type': 'heartbeat', 'phase', 'elapsed_s'}``
event is appended (monotonic seq + WS push + ``updated_at`` touch — the
append IS the reap-clock reset). Zero LLM cost; a 5-minute phase adds ~30
rows to the event log, which the cursor protocol digests natively.
