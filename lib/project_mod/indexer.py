"""Context generation for project co-pilot.

The LLM relies entirely on tool-based exploration (grep_search, find_files,
list_dir, read_files) to understand project structure at runtime.

This module provides ``get_context_for_prompt()`` which assembles
the system-prompt context block (project path, CLAUDE.md, multi-root
instructions, tool docs).  No file tree is injected — the model
discovers the project structure on demand via tools.

Tools for code exploration:
- list_dir(path) — List directory contents
- read_files(reads) — Read one or more files/ranges in a single call (up to 20). Each entry: {path, start_line?, end_line?}
- grep_search(pattern, path?, include?) — Search patterns (regex) across files
- find_files(pattern, path?) — Find files by name glob

Tools for code modification:
- write_file(path, content, description?) — Write/create a file (overwrites entirely)
- apply_diff(path, search, replace, description?, replace_all?) — Apply targeted search-and-replace edit
  Set replace_all=true to replace ALL occurrences (default: errors on multiple matches for safety).
  For MULTIPLE edits, pass an 'edits' array: apply_diff(edits=[{path, search, replace, replace_all?, description?}, ...])
  Edits are applied sequentially so later edits see earlier changes. Much faster than separate calls.
- insert_content(path, anchor, content, position?, description?) — Insert new content before or after an anchor string without replacing it.
  The 'anchor' must match exactly once (errors on 0 or multiple matches, like apply_diff's search).
  position='before' or 'after' (default: 'after'). For MULTIPLE insertions, pass an 'edits' array.
- run_command(command, timeout?, working_dir?) — Execute shell command. In multi-root workspaces, use working_dir='rootname:' to run in a specific root.

Token-saving tools (use these to avoid re-generating existing content):
- emit_to_user(comment) — TERMINAL: end your turn by pointing the user to the most recent tool result they can already see, instead of re-outputting it.
  Use when a tool's raw output fully answers the question (e.g. command output, file contents, search results).
  The user sees all tool results in expandable panels. Just add a brief comment — do NOT repeat the output.
  This is a TERMINAL tool — calling it ends your turn immediately. Do NOT call other tools after this.
- write_file supports content_ref={tool_round, start?, end?} INSTEAD of content — to write a previous tool result to a file without regenerating it.
  Example: write_file(path="output.txt", content_ref={"tool_round": 3}) writes round 3's output to the file.
  Use content_ref whenever you need to save/copy content that already exists as a tool result from an earlier round.

Strategy:
1. Start with list_dir('.') to understand project structure, then use find_files() for specific files
2. Use grep_search to locate relevant code
3. Use read_files to examine files — batch multiple paths/ranges into ONE call to minimize round-trips
4. Provide answers with specific file paths and line numbers
5. When suggesting changes, show exact code with file path
6. Use apply_diff for small targeted edits, write_file for new files or major rewrites
7. When making multiple edits, prefer batch apply_diff(edits=[...]) over separate calls — this dramatically reduces round trips
8. **Prefer insert_content over apply_diff when the change is purely additive** (adding new lines without modifying existing ones). Examples: adding an import, appending to end of file, inserting a new function/method/block before or after existing code. insert_content is simpler (no need to repeat the anchor in both search and replace) and less error-prone.

⚠️ IMPORTANT — read WIDE, not narrow:
- When reading a function or class, read 200+ lines in one shot — don't read 50-line fragments and come back for more
- Prefer reading the WHOLE file (omit start_line/end_line) for files under 500 lines
- The server auto-expands to whole-file for files under ~40KB regardless of range, so don't worry about requesting too much
