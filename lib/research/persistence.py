"""lib/research/persistence.py — durable home for auto-research artifacts.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS (epic pt_a40dbd9569194b52)
-------------------------------------------------
Every R1–R4 artifact used to live ONLY in the in-process task dict of
``ProductionRuntime('research', ttl=7200)``. ``cleanup_stale()`` evicts
terminal tasks past TTL, so roughly two hours after a run finished — and
*instantly* on any server restart — the accepted ideas, the rejection audit
with its four-axis rubric scores, the survey markdown and the open-gap map
were gone for good.

That was never the design. ``docs/AUTO_RESEARCH_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`` §5 places
these artifacts in ``paper_reports`` under composite ``lang`` keys, explicitly
noting it needs "not one line of new schema". Both key functions
(:func:`lib.paper.survey.survey_lang_key`, :func:`lib.paper.ideate.ideate_lang_key`)
were written and exported — and had ZERO callers in the entire tree, while the
sibling ``insight_lang_key`` had nineteen. The persistence layer was specified,
half-built, and never wired up. This module is the missing half.

DESIGN NOTES
------------
**One writer, not a second one.** Rows go through
``lib.database._core_schema.upsert(db, PAPER_REPORTS, …)`` — the exact call
:func:`lib.paper.insight_engine._run._persist_insight` uses. Same schema, same
upsert semantics, same PG/SQLite bridge. No hand-rolled SQL lives here.

**Identity: a direction is not a paper.** ``paper_reports.paper_hash`` is
content-addressable for papers. A research *direction* is free text a human
retypes, so its hash is (a) case- and whitespace-normalised, so "  KV Cache "
and "kv cache" hit one row instead of paying for the pipeline twice, and
(b) NAMESPACED with a prefix, so a direction can never collide with the row of
a paper whose text happens to match.

**Where the structure goes.** ``report`` is the human-readable body and
``meta`` the JSON descriptor, per the established convention:

  * ``survey:<lang>`` — ``report`` = the survey markdown (naturally readable);
    ``meta`` carries the ``open_gaps`` map (a machine contract, not prose).
  * ``ideate:<lang>`` — the artifact is inherently structured (scored ideas +
    a rejection audit), so ``meta`` carries it in full. ``report`` gets a short
    human-readable digest so a reader opening the row directly is not met with
    raw JSON.

**Failure posture: never destroy an expensive artifact.** An ideate pass costs
many LLM calls. If the DB write fails, these functions log loudly and return
``False`` — the artifact still flows back to the caller and on to the user.
Persistence failing must never take down a run that already did the work.
