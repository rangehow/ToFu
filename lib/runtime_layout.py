"""lib/runtime_layout.py — Single source of truth for the install-tree
runtime-state ⇄ shippable-code boundary.

Sibling of :mod:`lib.agent_artifacts`. Where ``agent_artifacts`` enumerates the
**project-local** artifacts the assistant writes into a *user's* project (the
``.tofu*`` prefix family), THIS module enumerates the paths under the **Tofu
install root itself** that are mutable user / runtime state rather than
shippable source:

  * ``data/``            — databases, per-project config, fetched-file staging.
  * ``logs/``            — application logs (contain queries / personal content).
  * ``uploads/``         — user-uploaded images.
  * ``outputs/``         — eval / smoke-test output (transient).
  * ``overleaf_cache/``  — fetched Overleaf projects (regenerable cache).
  * ``lib/.project_sessions/`` — per-project undo/redo history (pre-image blobs).
  * ``static/js/bundle-``— the auto-generated JS bundle (rebuilt at startup).
  * ``.tofu/`` (+ any ``.tofu*``) — the assistant's own memories / file-history
    in the install tree, delegated to :func:`lib.agent_artifacts.is_agent_artifact`.

Why this exists
---------------
The classification *"which install-tree paths are mutable state an update must
NEVER clobber"* was historically **hand-duplicated** across three consumers
that had to be kept in sync by hand:

  * ``lib/self_update.py`` — ``_RUNTIME_STATE_PREFIXES`` (dirty-tree classify)
    and ``_OVERLAY_SKIP_PREFIXES`` (tarball-overlay skip).
  * ``export.py``          — the runtime-state subset of ``*_EXCLUDE_DIRS``.
  * ``.gitignore``         — ``data/`` / ``logs/`` / ``uploads/`` / … entries.

Drift between them is exactly what makes an auto-update fragile: forget an
entry in the update skip-list and a whole-tree overlay clobbers the user's DB;
forget it in ``.gitignore`` and the state leaks into version control. This
module fixes that the same way ``agent_artifacts`` fixed the ``.tofu*`` family:
define the boundary ONCE here, and have every consumer derive from it. Adding a
new runtime dir next year is a one-line edit to :data:`INSTALL_STATE`, and every
consumer picks it up with no further code change.

Scope note — this is the "what is mutable state" axis ONLY. It is deliberately
NOT the export sanitizer's "what is shippable in a public release" axis: dirs
like ``sundries/`` / ``benchmarks/`` / ``debug/`` / ``promo/`` are excluded from
exports because they are not part of the product, not because they are user
state. Those stay in ``export.py`` and are NOT unified here — conflating the two
axes would be the wrong abstraction.

No ``lib.*`` imports beyond :mod:`lib.agent_artifacts` (itself stdlib-only), so
any producer or consumer can import this without an import cycle.
