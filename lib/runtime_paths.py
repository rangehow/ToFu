r"""lib/runtime_paths.py — Single source of truth for the writable data/logs roots.

Historically every module computed its data/logs location as
``dirname(dirname(__file__))/data`` — i.e. the *repository* root. That is
correct for a source checkout, but WRONG for a frozen desktop build:

  * PyInstaller ``--onedir`` lays the app out as
    ``C:\Program Files\Tofu\Tofu.exe`` + ``C:\Program Files\Tofu\_internal\``,
    with ``lib/`` living under ``_internal/``. So ``dirname(dirname(__file__))``
    resolves *inside* ``_internal`` — a directory under ``Program Files`` that a
    standard (non-admin) user CANNOT write to. Every attempt to create
    ``data/pgdata``, ``data/config``, ``data/tofu.db`` or ``logs/`` then fails
    with ``PermissionError`` and the app crashes on first launch.

The fix: resolve the *writable* data/logs roots ONCE, here, honouring (in order):

  1. ``$TOFU_DATA_DIR`` — an explicit override. The desktop launcher sets this
     to a writable ``data/`` directory next to the executable
     (``desktop/launcher.py``). Also useful for source runs that want a
     relocated data dir.
  2. Frozen build with no override → a per-user, always-writable location:
     ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\Tofu`` on Windows, ``~/.local/share/Tofu`` elsewhere.
     (The exe-sibling ``data/`` is preferred only when it is actually
     writable — a portable/unzipped build — otherwise we fall back to the
     per-user dir so a Program Files install still works.)
  3. Source checkout → the repository root (unchanged legacy behaviour).

``data_root()`` and ``logs_root()`` return absolute paths and guarantee the
directory exists. Modules that used to write ``os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'data')``
should call ``data_root()`` instead so a single policy governs every artifact.
