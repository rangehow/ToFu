"""lib/skills/injection.py — System prompt injection and skill context building.

Only a compact XML index of skill names + descriptions is injected into
the system prompt. The agent uses read_file to load full skill content
on-demand.

Budget management (aligned with Claude Code):
  • Skills get 1% of the context window (in characters).
  • Progressive degradation when over budget:
      1. Full descriptions (capped at 250 chars each)
      2. Truncated descriptions to fit budget
      3. Names-only (extreme case)
  • Default budget: 8000 chars (~2000 tokens) — 1% of 200K × 4 chars/token.
  • Path templates in header → per-entry IDs only (saves ~50 chars/skill).

SKILL_ACCUMULATION_INSTRUCTIONS = """<skill_accumulation>
You have skill management tools to maintain a reusable knowledge base across sessions:
- `create_skill` — Save a NEW skill (accumulated experience).
- `update_skill` — Update an EXISTING skill's content, description, or tags.
- `delete_skill` — Remove an outdated or incorrect skill.
- `merge_skills` — Combine multiple overlapping/related skills into one consolidated skill.

You should PROACTIVELY manage skills when any of these situations occur:

**When to CREATE a skill:**
1. **Bug pattern discovered** — You helped debug a tricky issue. Save the root cause and fix pattern.
2. **Project convention learned** — You noticed a coding style, naming convention, directory layout, or architectural pattern.
3. **User preference revealed** — The user corrected you or expressed a preference for how things should be done.
4. **Complex workflow completed** — You executed a multi-step task (build, deploy, refactor). Save the steps as a repeatable recipe.
5. **Tool/API quirk found** — You discovered an undocumented behavior, version-specific workaround, or configuration gotcha.

**When to UPDATE a skill:**
- You discover new information that extends or corrects an existing skill.
- A skill's description is too vague and needs improvement.
- A skill's content is partially outdated but still useful.

**When to DELETE a skill:**
- A skill is completely outdated (e.g. library upgraded, API changed).
- A skill contains incorrect information that could be harmful.
- A skill is a duplicate of another, better skill.

**When to MERGE skills:**
- Two or more skills cover overlapping topics and would be better as one consolidated skill.
- Multiple small skills could be combined into a comprehensive guide.

Guidelines:
- Keep each skill focused on ONE topic — don't bundle unrelated lessons.
- Use `scope='project'` for project-specific knowledge, `scope='global'` for general patterns.
- Write the body as clear, actionable Markdown instructions (not a conversation recap).
- Don't duplicate — if you've already saved a similar skill, skip it (or merge it).
- Don't ask the user for permission — just manage skills quietly when relevant.
- Tag skills for easier filtering (e.g. `['python', 'debugging']`, `['react', 'convention']`).

⚠️ **Description quality is critical** — the description is the ONLY thing injected into the
system prompt (skill bodies are loaded on-demand). A vague description means the skill will
never be found. Write descriptions that are:
  - At least 20 characters, ideally 40-80 characters
  - Specific about WHEN the skill applies (e.g. "Fix for Flask SQLAlchemy circular import when using blueprints")
  - NOT generic (avoid "useful tips", "some notes about X")
  - Include key trigger words that would appear in a relevant user query

# Compact version (~400 chars) — stays in the system message for cache stability.
