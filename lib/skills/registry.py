"""lib/skills/registry.py — Installed skill-package enumeration.

A *skill package* is a user-installed instruction bundle (Anthropic
AgentSkills / OpenClaw format): a directory holding a ``SKILL.md`` with
YAML frontmatter plus optional ``references/`` / ``scripts/`` / ``assets/``
sub-files. Skills are a DIFFERENT NOUN from memories:

  * memories are MODEL-authored experience notes (flat ``*.md``), discovered
    by BM25 search / prefetch;
  * skills are USER-installed capability packs, discovered by the
    always-visible ``<available_skills>`` system-prompt index and activated
    on demand (see ``lib/skills/injection.py`` + ``lib/skills/activate.py``).

Physical homes (post-split, see ``lib/memory/storage/_dirs.py``):

  * project scope → ``<project>/.tofu/skills/<id>/``
  * global scope  → ``<data>/skills/global/<id>/``

This module reuses the memory storage layer's file helpers
(``_memory_from_file`` gives the frontmatter parse + eligibility gating +
``.catalog_id`` marker handling) so a skill dict has the same shape the
Settings UI already renders (``eligible`` / ``ineligible_reasons`` /
``is_package`` / ``package_dir`` / ``catalog_id`` …).
