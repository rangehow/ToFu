"""lib/swarm/liveness.py — the ONE liveness judgement for the whole swarm.

Before this module, three independent clocks decided when to stop a swarm, and
none of them looked at whether work was actually being produced:

  * the driver's ``iter_completions(timeout=600)`` — a whole-swarm budget fixed
    at the instant the generator started, so a second-wave agent inherited a
    deadline set before it existed;
  * ``SubTaskSpec.timeout_seconds=1800`` — checked only at the TOP of a round,
    therefore structurally unreachable for an agent blocked inside a tool
    (measured: one agent sat in a ``pytest`` child for >1h and never tripped it);
  * ``_session_timestamps[key]`` — stamped once in ``_set_session`` and never
    refreshed, so ``_cleanup_stale_sessions`` called ``session.abort()`` on a
    swarm that had been busy the entire time (measured: 105 occurrences).

All three answered "how long has this existed?" when the only question that
justifies killing work is "has it stopped producing?". A wall clock cannot tell
a productive 40-minute agent from a wedged one; it only guarantees that the
longer a task legitimately takes, the more certain we are to destroy it right
before it delivers.

This module holds the replacement: a per-agent monotonic record of the last
observed PROGRESS EVENT. Everything that used to own a deadline now asks
:meth:`ProgressBeacon.is_making_progress` instead. A swarm is stopped only when
it has genuinely gone quiet, so a long job that keeps producing is never
interrupted — and a truly wedged one is still caught, by the absence of output
rather than by the passage of time.

Progress is anything that proves forward motion:
  round start · token/thinking delta · tool dispatched · tool returned ·
  tool subprocess output · agent settled.

Monotonic by construction (``time.monotonic``): this drives control-flow
decisions and must not be perturbed by a wall-clock step. Wall-clock instants
for the UI stay in ``scheduler._started_at``.

#  Thread-scoped progress sink — the TOOL-level heartbeat
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# The stall check above is only as good as the signals feeding it, and the
# worst real hang produces NO agent-level signal at all: ``coder-tests`` called
# ``run_command`` with no timeout, the pytest child never returned, and the
# agent sat inside one tool call for over an hour. Round starts, tokens and
# tool returns all stop at the moment of entry, so a purely agent-level beacon
# would declare that agent stalled while its subprocess was healthily printing
# test results — reintroducing the very "kill the productive one" failure this
# work removes.
#
# So the tool layer must heartbeat too. It is threaded through a CONTEXTVAR
# rather than a parameter on every tool signature: a sub-agent's tool runs on
# its own thread, so the binding is unambiguous, and ``run_command`` (plus any
# future long tool) can report progress WITHOUT importing swarm or knowing a
# beacon exists. Zero coupling in the tool, no plumbing through
# ``_execute_tool_one``'s whole call chain.
#
# Outside a swarm the contextvar is unset and ``notify_tool_progress`` is a
# no-op, so the main chat path is byte-unaffected.
