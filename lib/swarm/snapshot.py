"""lib/swarm/snapshot.py — durable swarm agent snapshot persistence.

The swarm "Parallel Execution" panel's per-agent state (``_swarmAgents``)
is synthesized live on the FRONTEND from ``swarm_*`` SSE events and is never
persisted. After a reload it is gone, so the panel could only rebuild
objective-only stubs from the spawn handle, and fire-and-forget swarms
(spawned but never ``await_agents``-ed) rendered every agent as ``unknown``.

This module is the ROOT-CAUSE fix: when the swarm settles (and incrementally
as each agent completes), the authoritative per-agent state from the
``MasterOrchestrator`` is written DURABLY onto the ``spawn_agents`` tool round
inside ``conversations.messages`` — the same source-of-truth store the rest of
the tool rounds already persist to. On reload the frontend prefers this
snapshot (``round._swarmSnapshot``) and renders a faithful, fully-expandable
panel with real status/preview/tokens/elapsed/modifiedFiles — even with no
``await_agents`` sibling round and no live ``_swarmAgents`` array.

The write is best-effort and CAS-guarded (mirrors
``manager._sync_partial_to_conversation``): it must NEVER raise into the swarm
driver thread, and must never clobber a concurrent frontend write.
