"""lib/swarm/tools.py — Tool definitions for the async swarm protocol.

Two levels of swarm tools:

  1. **MASTER_TOOLS** — exposed to the main orchestrator LLM.

     • ``spawn_agents``      — fire-and-forget; returns a handle immediately
     • ``await_agents``      — block until ≥1 / all listed agents complete
     • ``get_agent_result``  — fetch one agent's full result
     • ``store_artifact`` / ``read_artifact`` / ``list_artifacts``
                             — shared key-value store

     Sub-agent results arrive as ``<swarm-update>...</swarm-update>`` user
     messages auto-injected at round boundaries (see ``lib/agent_inbox.py``).
     The model never has to poll.

  2. **SUB_AGENT_TOOLS** — granted to each sub-agent ON TOP of its
     role-scoped tool list. These are strictly the artifact tools:
     sub-agents can store/read/list, but **cannot** spawn, await, or
     query siblings — they have no view of the swarm at all.

Removed in the async migration (no longer exist):
  • ``check_agents``       — async push removes the need to poll status
  • ``spawn_more_agents``  — main agent uses ``spawn_agents`` again instead
  • ``swarm_done``          — async swarm has no internal mini-master to "stop"
