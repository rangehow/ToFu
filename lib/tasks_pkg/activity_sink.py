"""lib/tasks_pkg/activity_sink.py — Default project-activity sink adapter.

This is the **host side** of the agent base's activity-feed seam (see
:mod:`lib.agent_core.activity`).  The reusable agent base (orchestrator,
endpoint, compaction — the ``CORE_MODULES`` in ``lib/agent_core_manifest.py``)
must NOT import ``lib.conversations`` directly; it emits a project-brain
Activity Feed pulse through :func:`lib.agent_core.activity.emit_activity_event`,
which — absent a host override — routes here.

Because this adapter binds the concrete ``lib.conversations.project_feed``
implementation, it lives OUTSIDE ``lib/agent_core/`` (a ``CORE_MODULES``
location, forbidden from importing ``lib.conversations``) — exactly mirroring
how :mod:`lib.tasks_pkg.persistence_store` is the DB-bound adapter behind the
``ConversationStore`` seam.
