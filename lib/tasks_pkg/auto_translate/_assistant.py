"""The core server-side auto-translate safety net for assistant replies.

Home of ``_maybe_auto_translate_assistant`` — the index-based, post-persist
translation trigger. It honours the per-conversation ``autoTranslate`` setting,
dedups against an already-running frontend translate task via the in-flight
guard, detects + re-does stale partial translations, short-circuits already-
Chinese content, and hands off to the incremental per-round translator when
one is active.

Dependencies are one-directional: DB helpers from ``lib.database``, the
translate engine lazily from ``lib.translate`` (facade path
``lib.translate.runtime._do_translate`` stays valid) and ``lib.text_lang`` —
never ``manager``.
