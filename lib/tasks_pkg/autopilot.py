"""Autopilot mode — virtual user that auto-replies when the LLM stops.

When the model would normally hand control back to the user (either by
calling ``ask_human`` or by emitting a final assistant message with
``finish_reason='stop'``), Autopilot runs a one-shot LLM as the *user*
and feeds its reply back to the orchestrator as a brand-new turn.

Design constraints (locked in by the user, do not relax silently):

  • **Runs BEFORE the ``done`` SSE event.**  The hook fires inside
    ``_finalize_and_emit_done`` after the post-loop work but *before*
    ``append_event(done_evt)`` / ``persist_task_result``.  This lets
    the ``done`` event carry ``autopilotNextTaskId`` +
    ``autopilotVuMessage`` so the frontend attaches to the follow-up
    task directly instead of polling ``/api/chat/active`` after the
    SSE stream has already closed.  (Earlier design ran autopilot
    *after* persist; the SSE pipe was closed by the time the VU
    finished, so the synthetic user msg was invisible until manual
    refresh.)

  • **Independent of endpoint mode.**  Autopilot and endpoint mode are
    mutually exclusive — both share the same termination boundary
    ("the model stopped") so running them together would double-loop.
    The frontend hides one toggle when the other is on; this module
    additionally bails out when ``task['_endpoint_managed']`` is set.

  • **Reuse the conversation's main model.**  No separate VU model.

  • **Same tools as the worker.**  The VU runs through the full
    orchestrator (``_run_single_turn``) so it has access to every tool
    the parent task has — read_files, search, project edits, browser,
    memory, MCP, etc.  This lets the simulated user investigate before
    composing its reply (e.g. "let me check the file the assistant
    referenced before answering").  Inherited from
    ``task['config']`` verbatim — same tool list as
    ``_assemble_tool_list`` would build for the parent.

  • **Role override via a trailing directive turn**, mirroring how
    endpoint-mode's planner/critic announce their role.  We do NOT
    role-swap the conversation history: the LLM sees the real
    conversation and a final user-turn that says "for THIS turn play
    the simulated user".  Prefix-cache-friendly and avoids the
    swapped-history confusion with the orchestrator's injected
    system prompt.

  • **Full conversation passed through.**  We do NOT trim history
    here; the orchestrator's compaction layer (run_compaction_pipeline)
    handles bounding.  This keeps tool_calls / tool_result pairs
    contiguous and removes one place where context choices can drift
    between the worker and the simulated user.

  • **No turn cap, no state-change watchdog.**  The only graceful stop
    signal is the VU itself emitting ``[VU: TASK_DONE]``.  Other stops
    are: real-user abort, real-user sending a new message (handled
    automatically by ``abort_running_tasks_for_conv``), an error path,
    or the queue having a real queued message waiting (deferred to).

  • **Empty VU output does NOT stop the loop.**  An empty reply is
    treated as a valid "yeah, keep going" — the orchestrator just
    starts a fresh turn with that empty user message.  This is the
    user's explicit choice — see the design discussion in
    docs/ARCHITECTURE.md if rebooting decisions.

The "don't stop on empty output" rule means the only correctness escape
hatch is the real user clicking Stop or sending a new message.  Both are
already wired through ``task['aborted']`` and the freshness guard in
``manager._conv_latest_task``, so we don't need extra plumbing here.

    'You are the PROJECT OWNER driving this task to completion. The '

    'Trust nothing you have not checked. The assistant\'s self-report '
    '("done", "tests pass", "I created X") is a claim, not evidence.\n\n'
    'Before you reply, do this:\n'
    '1. VERIFY the assistant\'s most consequential claim using your '
    'tools. If it said tests pass, run or inspect them; if it said it '
    'created/edited a file, read_files it; if it claimed a behavior '
    'works, check it. You MUST verify any checkable claim that the '
    'objective depends on — do not skip this.\n'
    '2. ASSESS the gap between the real current state and the objective '
    'stated at the top of this turn.\n'
    '3. DECIDE the genuine next step toward that objective — NOT merely '
    'a response to whatever the assistant last said. If the assistant '
    'asked you a decision question, answer it from the objective\'s '
    'perspective. If it declared the task finished, hold it to the '
    'objective\'s acceptance criteria.\n'
    '4. THINK CREATIVELY. A good owner does more than grade the '
    'assistant\'s homework. Use what you learned while investigating to '
    'surface things the assistant has NOT considered: an edge case or '
    'failure mode it missed, a simpler or more robust approach, a '
    'hidden assumption worth challenging, a related part of the '

    'root causes over patches.\n'
    '- For open-ended discussion: use your own judgment, stay concrete, '
    'pick a direction instead of asking more questions.\n'
    '- If the objective is a SUBJECTIVE or one-shot question (advice, an '
    'explanation, an opinion, a recommendation) with NOTHING to verify '
    'with tools and NO further acceptance criteria, and the assistant '
    'has already answered it substantively and correctly, then the '

    f'{_VU_DONE_SENTINEL} — do NOT invent a follow-up, do NOT ask the '
    'assistant what it meant, and do NOT role-swap into answering as an '
    'assistant would. A genuinely complete one-shot answer concludes the '
    'run; manufacturing more turns is the failure mode to avoid.\n'
    '- Stop ONLY when you have VERIFIED that the objective\'s acceptance '
    'criteria are genuinely met (the check actually ran, the file is '
    'actually correct, the behavior actually works) — not when the '
    'assistant says so. When (and only when) that is true, reply '
    f'EXACTLY: {_VU_DONE_SENTINEL}\n'

    'verified or the criterion you are holding the assistant to.\n'
    '- Output ONLY the reply text — no quotation marks, no role labels, '
    f'no preamble. The {_VU_DONE_SENTINEL} sentinel must appear on its '
    'own when used.\n'

    'line, in this exact form:\n'
    '  [PROGRESS: resolved=X remaining=Y]\n'
    '  where X = the number of the objective\'s acceptance criteria you '

    ``append_event`` globally.

    For each VU event we still append it to the underlying list (so the

    events onto the PARENT task's stream:

         instead of materializing the whole bubble after the VU
         finishes.  The wrapper carries ``vuMsgId`` so the frontend can
         target the right message.

    The synthetic-user bubble itself is created eagerly by the
    ``autopilot_vu_start`` event (emitted from ``maybe_run_autopilot``
    BEFORE the VU sub-task runs), so the user sees an "Autopilot ·
    composing…" bubble in the USER lane the moment the worker stops —
    NOT a phase chip glued to the worker bubble.  All VU thinking, tool
    calls, and reply text then stream into that bubble via the wrapped

    When the server dies while an autopilot follow-up is in flight, the

    the loop — so the run is left settled-but-armed and only continues on the

    SCOPE — the DURABLE armed-marker is the AUTHORITATIVE source, NOT the set of
    crash-recovered tasks. We enumerate :func:`list_armed_autopilot_convs` (every
    conv carrying a ``KIND_AUTOPILOT`` marker row, which survives restart) and

    an armed marker but was never an interrupted task — so it is absent from
    ``recovered_conv_ids`` yet must still resume. ``extra_conv_ids`` (the
    recovery set) is unioned in for belt-and-braces, but the marker scan is what
    guarantees completeness.

    Only conversations with an armed marker are resumed — a run that concluded
    cleanly (``[VU: TASK_DONE]``) or was disarmed cleared its marker, so it is
    correctly left alone. ``kick_autopilot`` itself refuses (``taskId=None``) if
    a live non-VU task is already running for the conv, so calling it
    unconditionally is safe — no double-driving. Best-effort per conv: one
    failure never aborts the batch.
