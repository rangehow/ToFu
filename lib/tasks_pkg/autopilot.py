"""Autopilot mode — virtual user that auto-replies when the LLM stops.

When the model would normally hand control back to the user (either by
calling ``ask_human`` or by emitting a final assistant message with
``finish_reason='stop'``), Autopilot runs a one-shot LLM as the *user*
and feeds its reply back to the orchestrator as a brand-new turn.

Design constraints (locked in by the user, do not relax silently):

  • **Runs BEFORE the ``done`` SSE event.**  The hook fires inside
    ``_finalize_and_emit_done`` after the post-loop work but *before*
    ``append_event(done_evt)`` / ``persist_task_result``.  This lets
    the ``done`` event carry ``autopilotNextTaskId`` +
    ``autopilotVuMessage`` so the frontend attaches to the follow-up
    task directly instead of polling ``/api/chat/active`` after the
    SSE stream has already closed.  (Earlier design ran autopilot
    *after* persist; the SSE pipe was closed by the time the VU
    finished, so the synthetic user msg was invisible until manual
    refresh.)

  • **Independent of endpoint mode.**  Autopilot and endpoint mode are
    mutually exclusive — both share the same termination boundary
    ("the model stopped") so running them together would double-loop.
    The frontend hides one toggle when the other is on; this module
    additionally bails out when ``task['_endpoint_managed']`` is set.

  • **Reuse the conversation's main model.**  No separate VU model.

  • **Same tools as the worker.**  The VU runs through the full
    orchestrator (``_run_single_turn``) so it has access to every tool
    the parent task has — read_files, search, project edits, browser,
    memory, MCP, etc.  This lets the simulated user investigate before
    composing its reply (e.g. "let me check the file the assistant
    referenced before answering").  Inherited from
    ``task['config']`` verbatim — same tool list as
    ``_assemble_tool_list`` would build for the parent.

  • **Role override via a trailing directive turn**, mirroring how
    endpoint-mode's planner/critic announce their role.  We do NOT
    role-swap the conversation history: the LLM sees the real
    conversation and a final user-turn that says "for THIS turn play
    the simulated user".  Prefix-cache-friendly and avoids the
    swapped-history confusion with the orchestrator's injected
    system prompt.

  • **Full conversation passed through.**  We do NOT trim history
    here; the orchestrator's compaction layer (run_compaction_pipeline)
    handles bounding.  This keeps tool_calls / tool_result pairs
    contiguous and removes one place where context choices can drift
    between the worker and the simulated user.

  • **No turn cap, no state-change watchdog.**  The only graceful stop
    signal is the VU itself emitting ``[VU: TASK_DONE]``.  Other stops
    are: real-user abort, real-user sending a new message (handled
    automatically by ``abort_running_tasks_for_conv``), an error path,
    or the queue having a real queued message waiting (deferred to).

  • **Empty VU output does NOT stop the loop.**  An empty reply is
    treated as a valid "yeah, keep going" — the orchestrator just
    starts a fresh turn with that empty user message.  This is the
    user's explicit choice — see the design discussion in
    docs/ARCHITECTURE.md if rebooting decisions.

The "don't stop on empty output" rule means the only correctness escape
hatch is the real user clicking Stop or sending a new message.  Both are
already wired through ``task['aborted']`` and the freshness guard in
``manager._conv_latest_task``, so we don't need extra plumbing here.

    'You are the PROJECT OWNER driving this task to completion. The '

    'actually met.\n\n'
    'Trust nothing you have not checked. The assistant\'s self-report '
    '("done", "tests pass", "I created X") is a claim, not evidence.\n\n'
    'Before you reply, do this:\n'
    '1. VERIFY the assistant\'s most consequential claim using your '
    'tools. If it said tests pass, run or inspect them; if it said it '
    'created/edited a file, read_files it; if it claimed a behavior '
    'works, check it. You MUST verify any checkable claim that the '
    'objective depends on — do not skip this.\n'
    '2. ASSESS the gap between the real current state and the objective '
    'stated at the top of this turn.\n'
    '3. DECIDE the genuine next step toward that objective — NOT merely '
    'a response to whatever the assistant last said. If the assistant '
    'asked you a decision question, answer it from the objective\'s '
    'perspective. If it declared the task finished, hold it to the '
    'objective\'s acceptance criteria.\n'
    '4. THINK CREATIVELY. A good owner does more than grade the '
    'assistant\'s homework. Use what you learned while investigating to '
    'surface things the assistant has NOT considered: an edge case or '
    'failure mode it missed, a simpler or more robust approach, a '
    'hidden assumption worth challenging, a related part of the '
    'objective it has not touched yet, or a concrete improvement. When '
    'you have such an insight, lead with it — it is more valuable than '

    'Your tool calls and your private reasoning are NOT sent to the '

    'but distil the result: your reply must be a clean, self-contained '
    'instruction that stands on its own without the investigation behind '

    '- For code / engineering tasks: demand the most robust long-term '
    'solution. Do not accept shortcuts that optimize for cost, '
    'implementation speed, or backward compatibility. Prefer fixing '
    'root causes over patches.\n'
    '- For open-ended discussion: use your own judgment, stay concrete, '
    'pick a direction instead of asking more questions.\n'
    '- If the objective is a SUBJECTIVE or one-shot question (advice, an '
    'explanation, an opinion, a recommendation) with NOTHING to verify '
    'with tools and NO further acceptance criteria, and the assistant '
    'has already answered it substantively and correctly, then the '
    'objective IS met: reply EXACTLY '
    f'{_VU_DONE_SENTINEL} — do NOT invent a follow-up, do NOT ask the '
    'assistant what it meant, and do NOT role-swap into answering as an '
    'assistant would. A genuinely complete one-shot answer concludes the '
    'run; manufacturing more turns is the failure mode to avoid.\n'
    '- Stop ONLY when you have VERIFIED that the objective\'s acceptance '
    'criteria are genuinely met (the check actually ran, the file is '
    'actually correct, the behavior actually works) — not when the '
    'assistant says so. When (and only when) that is true, reply '
    f'EXACTLY: {_VU_DONE_SENTINEL}\n'
    '- If the objective is NOT yet met, give the assistant the specific '
    'unmet criterion or the next concrete step. Do not emit '
    f'{_VU_DONE_SENTINEL} while anything remains unresolved.\n'
    '- HANDOFF (park the residual): if the ONLY thing keeping the objective '
    'from being met is BLOCKED on an EXTERNAL commit the assistant cannot '
    'itself resolve — e.g. a SIBLING conversation must land a file first, or a '
    'fresh-HEAD verification cannot run until another workstream commits — then '
    'do NOT keep nudging (it would only churn) and do NOT falsely declare '
    'victory. Instead reply with your concise reasoning (what is done, what '
    'remains, which files/commits it waits on) and end with EXACTLY:\n'
    '  [VU: HANDOFF paths=<file1>,<file2>]\n'
    'listing the repo-relative path(s) the residual waits on (comma-separated, '
    'no spaces inside the list). This parks the remaining work on the project '
    'board keyed on those paths, so it AUTO-RESUMES the moment the dependency '
    'is committed — no human babysitting. Use HANDOFF only for a genuine '
    'external block, never as an escape hatch from work the assistant could do '
    'now.\n'
    '- Never invent product requirements beyond the stated objective.\n'
    '- Reply in the first person as the owner, in the same language the '
    'assistant used. Be concise but cite the specific evidence you '
    'verified or the criterion you are holding the assistant to.\n'
    '- Output ONLY the reply text — no quotation marks, no role labels, '
    f'no preamble. The {_VU_DONE_SENTINEL} sentinel must appear on its '
    'own when used.\n'
    '- END your reply with EXACTLY ONE progress line, on its own final '
    'line, in this exact form:\n'
    '  [PROGRESS: resolved=X remaining=Y]\n'
    '  where X = the number of the objective\'s acceptance criteria you '

    'start of the run), and Y = the number that remain unmet. Base X on '
    'what you actually checked this turn, not on the assistant\'s claims. '
    'This line is a machine signal that lets the run detect when it is '
    'churning without real progress — it must be present and accurate on '

    'WHY it mattered toward the objective — the meaning, not the '

    '  - Never paste raw tool-call names, function signatures, internal '
    'identifiers (task IDs, run IDs, hashes), stack traces, or control '
    'markers like "[VU: TASK_DONE]" as if the reader knows them.\n'
    '  - When you must name a concrete artifact (a file, a command, a '
    'test), give it a one-line plain-language gloss of what it is and why '
    'it was touched — never a bare path or command with no explanation.\n'
    '  - Expand or drop jargon and abbreviations; if a term is '

    'information for the reader.\n\n'
    'Do not run any tools and do not start new work — just synthesise '
    'what is already in the transcript. Be honest: this is a debrief, not '
    'a victory lap. If the objective was only partially met or the '
    'evidence is thin, say so directly.\n\n'
    'Structure the report in the human\'s language with these sections '
    '(use Markdown headings):\n'
    '1. **Objective** — in one or two plain sentences, what the run was '
    'asked to achieve. Written so it makes sense with zero prior context.\n'
    '2. **Outcome** — lead with the verdict against the objective: was it '
    'met, partially met, or not met, and in one line, why.\n'
    '3. **What was done** — the meaningful steps and decisions, in plain '
    'language, condensed. Each artifact you mention gets a short gloss of '
    'what it is / why it mattered — not a bare list of files or commands.\n'
    '4. **Verification** — what was actually checked (tests that ran and '
    'their results, behaviour confirmed, outputs read back) versus merely '
    'claimed. State results in words, not just exit codes.\n'
    '5. **Gaps & risks** — what is NOT done, known limitations, '
    'follow-ups worth doing, or assumptions that remain unverified. If '
    'there are none, say so plainly.\n\n'

    The orchestrator drives all SSE updates by calling

    swapping ``sub_task['events']`` with this subclass we get a hook on
    every event the VU sub-task emits, without monkey-patching
    ``append_event`` globally.

    For each VU event we still append it to the underlying list (so the
    sub-task's own SSE stream stays intact for any reader that ever
    connects to it), and additionally forward two flavours of derived
    events onto the PARENT task's stream:

      1. ``autopilot_vu_event`` — wraps the original VU sub-task event
         (delta / tool_start / tool_result / tool_progress / tool_complete /
         tool_compacted / stdin_* / write_approval_request /
         human_guidance_*) so the frontend can render the VU's reply +
         tool calls into the synthetic-user bubble *as they happen*,
         instead of materializing the whole bubble after the VU
         finishes.  The wrapper carries ``vuMsgId`` so the frontend can
         target the right message.

    The synthetic-user bubble itself is created eagerly by the
    ``autopilot_vu_start`` event (emitted from ``maybe_run_autopilot``
    BEFORE the VU sub-task runs), so the user sees an "Autopilot ·
    composing…" bubble in the USER lane the moment the worker stops —
    NOT a phase chip glued to the worker bubble.  All VU thinking, tool
    calls, and reply text then stream into that bubble via the wrapped

    on a NORMAL end (a clean ``[VU: TASK_DONE]``): a run that finished its
    objective earns a close-out report. It is ``False`` on an ABNORMAL end —
    the budget/stuck/no_progress guard cut the run off, so the objective is

    so the run folds and the loop disarms) but SKIP the reporter entirely — the

    Returns the stored sidecar record, or ``None`` when a with-report run

    blocked on an EXTERNAL commit (a sibling must land a file first) and stamped
    ``task['_vu_handoff_paths']`` + ``_vu_handoff_text``. This routes the
    residual into the project board's EXISTING self-expiring primitive rather

    When the server dies while an autopilot follow-up is in flight, the

    interrupted assistant reply into the conversation, but it does NOT resume
    the loop — so the run is left settled-but-armed and only continues on the
    user's next manual send. This bridges that gap.

    SCOPE — the DURABLE armed-marker is the AUTHORITATIVE source, NOT the set of
    crash-recovered tasks. We enumerate :func:`list_armed_autopilot_convs` (every
    conv carrying a ``KIND_AUTOPILOT`` marker row, which survives restart) and
    re-kick each. This deliberately catches the armed-but-idle case that a

    carrier never spawned, or whose reply already finished before the crash, has
    an armed marker but was never an interrupted task — so it is absent from
    ``recovered_conv_ids`` yet must still resume. ``extra_conv_ids`` (the
    recovery set) is unioned in for belt-and-braces, but the marker scan is what
    guarantees completeness.

    Only conversations with an armed marker are resumed — a run that concluded
    cleanly (``[VU: TASK_DONE]``) or was disarmed cleared its marker, so it is
    correctly left alone. ``kick_autopilot`` itself refuses (``taskId=None``) if
    a live non-VU task is already running for the conv, so calling it
    unconditionally is safe — no double-driving. Best-effort per conv: one
    failure never aborts the batch.

    """Arm autopilot for a conversation whose task is already in flight.

    Use case: the user chatted with autopilot OFF, then decides to step
    away mid-reply and wants the virtual user to take over at the next
    natural stop.  Toggling the frontend button only affects the NEXT
    task — the in-flight task's ``config['autopilot']`` was frozen at
    creation time, so its end-of-turn hook would never fire.

    This flips ``config['autopilot'] = True`` on every live (status=
    ``running``) task for the conversation.  Because ``_finalize_and_emit_done``
    re-reads ``is_autopilot_enabled(task)`` at finalize, the running task
    will now run the VU hook when it stops.  Mutating ``config`` (rather
    than a side flag) also means the value propagates to autopilot
    follow-ups via ``_start_followup_task``'s ``dict(task['config'])``,
    so the loop continues until the VU emits ``[VU: TASK_DONE]``.

    Endpoint-managed tasks are skipped — autopilot and endpoint mode are
    mutually exclusive (they share the same termination boundary).

    Returns ``{'armed': bool, 'taskIds': [...]}`` — ``armed`` is True iff
    at least one live task was flipped.  When no task is live (the reply
    already finished), ``armed`` is False and the caller should rely on
    the persisted ``autopilotEnabled`` setting to kick off the loop on the
    user's next send.
