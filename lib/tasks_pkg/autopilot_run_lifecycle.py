"""Autopilot run close-out lifecycle — extracted from ``autopilot.py`` (pt_00459503 slice 3).

**Extraction context** (board epic ``pt_00459503f23b4c0e``, slice 3):
carved out of ``lib/tasks_pkg/autopilot.py`` per
``docs/AUTOPILOT_DECOMPOSITION_AUDIT.md``. Chose a SIBLING module rather
than a package conversion, matching slice 1 (``autopilot_state.py``) and
slice 2 (``autopilot_markers.py``).

**Why this slice closes the two-module cycle** (slice 2's residual debt):

  Slice 2 moved ``disarm_autopilot`` into ``autopilot_markers.py``, but
  its call to ``conclude_run`` had to stay lazy-imported at function
  scope because ``conclude_run`` remained in ``autopilot.py`` — and
  ``autopilot.py`` in turn re-exports the markers cluster from
  ``autopilot_markers``. That formed a two-module cycle that only
  worked because of the lazy-import posture.

  This slice moves ``conclude_run`` (and its three helpers
  ``_store_run_record``, ``_emit_run_concluded``,
  ``_emit_run_concluded_event``) into a brand-new LEAF module. The
  dependency chain becomes strictly downward::

      autopilot.py  ──(re-export)──▶ autopilot_run_lifecycle.py
                                                 │
                                                 ▼
                                       autopilot_state.py
      autopilot_markers.py  ──(top-level import)──▶ autopilot_run_lifecycle.py
                                                            │
                                                            ▼
                                                  autopilot_state.py

  ``autopilot_markers.py`` now imports ``conclude_run`` at MODULE TOP
  (no more lazy hack), because the leaf module has ZERO imports from
  ``autopilot.py``. The cycle is ELIMINATED, not merely guarded — a
  strict architectural upgrade over slice 2's lazy-import contract.

**pt_8dc03017 sequencing constraint**: the sibling epic
``pt_8dc030176bad450b`` (owner-parked, human-gated) plans to mutate
``_VUEventForwarder``, the ``_autopilot_deciding`` latch, and the VU
``convId=''`` opt-out. This module carries NONE of those symbols — the
close-out lifecycle is strictly disjoint from that mutation surface.

**What's in here**: the four functions that persist the terminal
"this autopilot run is over" fact + emit the associated pulse/SSE:

  * :func:`_store_run_record` — writes the single per-run record into
    ``settings.autopilotSummaries[run_id]`` under a per-conv lock, with
    reason-precedence + report-preservation + retention pruning.
  * :func:`_emit_run_concluded` — emits ONE project-brain
    ``run_concluded`` Activity event keyed on the run's project.
  * :func:`conclude_run` — the top-level close-out seam for the paths
    that end a run WITHOUT a clean ``[VU: TASK_DONE]`` (manual Stop,
    toggle-OFF disarm, superseding real user message).
  * :func:`_emit_run_concluded_event` — the report-free close-out that
    persists the record AND fires the pulse AND the SSE frame.

The facade module ``lib.tasks_pkg.autopilot`` re-exports every symbol
identity-preservingly so existing ``from lib.tasks_pkg.autopilot import
conclude_run`` call sites (autopilot_markers.disarm_autopilot; internal
autopilot.py callers) and tests that ``monkeypatch.setattr(ap,
'conclude_run', ...)`` keep working byte-identically.
