    Precedence: explicit client changes → prefix-byte mutation (with the EXACT
    changed ``key.field`` list when known) → TTL expiry → upstream eviction.

    The eviction verdict is GATED on evidence, not reached by elimination.
    ``wire_proven_identical`` is True only when the authoritative
    post-translation wire fingerprint (see ``wire_fingerprint.py``) showed the
    actual sent bytes were byte-for-byte identical to the previous round.
    CRUCIALLY, byte-identity proves only that the miss is NOT a client-side
    prefix change THIS ROUND — it says nothing about the cause. A byte-identical
    prefix that is not read back was not reused upstream; that is an ordinary
    upstream cache miss (a per-request gateway miss or a TTL boundary). The
    gateway forwards requests and does not evict, and there is no per-key cache
    capacity limit, so this is NOT shared-pool contention. So the verdict names
    an "upstream cache miss" WITHOUT asserting a single confident cause. NOTE the systemic picture: most cache
    misses in this system are CLIENT-side (already-cached bytes re-serialized
    differently across turns) — those take the ``<bytes>`` / ``prefix_mutation``
    branches above and are named there. This byte-identical branch is the
    comparatively RARE residual, so it must not over-claim.

    ⚠ The eviction verdict is DOUBLE-gated. ``wire_proven_identical`` requires
    BOTH the lossy canonical fingerprint AND the TRUE per-message serialized
    bytes (``wire_byte_prefix``) to match. The canonical fingerprint alone is
    NOT enough: it drops ``cache_control``, collapses ``str`` ↔ block, and
    skips ``reasoning_details`` — so a round can rebuild ``reasoning_details``,
    merge same-role turns, or switch protocol while canonical says "identical".
    When the raw bytes diverged, the caller has already appended a ``<bytes>``
    culprit (so this function takes the byte-divergence branch above), meaning
    we NEVER reach the eviction branch claiming "byte-identical" when the bytes
    were not. When no wire fingerprint was captured (non-Claude / capture
    failure) we fall back to the honestly-hedged "likely server/TTL OR silent
    byte change" wording — the elimination guess, explicitly marked unproven.
