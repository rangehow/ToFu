    When multiple tool results come back from parallel tool execution, their
    order in the messages array may vary between rounds if tools complete in
    different orders.  This causes the prefix to differ even though the
    content is identical, breaking automatic prefix caching (OpenAI/Qwen).

    For Anthropic explicit breakpoints, this is less critical since the
    breakpoints mark exact positions.  But it doesn't hurt and improves
    determinism.

    This function finds consecutive runs of tool-role messages and sorts
    them by tool_call_id.  It's called before build_body to ensure
    deterministic ordering.

    ★ CACHE-CRITICAL: reordering messages inside the prompt-cache PREFIX
    rewrites the cached prefix bytes and forces a full re-cache — the exact
    silent cache-killer this module otherwise hunts. So the sort is gated to
    indices at/after ``get_cache_prefix_count(conv_id)``: a run that begins
    inside the prefix is left untouched (it was already cached in some order;
    re-sorting it now can only HURT). Newly-appended tool results (the tail,
    which is what actually varies round-over-round) are still sorted. Runs
    that straddle the boundary are skipped entirely rather than partially
    sorted, which would itself mutate prefix bytes.

    Args:
        messages: The messages list (mutated in place).
        conv_id:  Conversation ID — used to look up the cache-prefix boundary.

    ★ CROSS-THREAD (per-conversation) boundary — the turn-boundary cache-kill
    fix. ``_state_key`` scopes CacheState per ``(conv_id, thread_id)`` so
    concurrent agents under one conv don't clobber each other's baseline. But
    a plain SEQUENTIAL new user turn runs on a NEW ``run_task`` worker thread,
    so the current thread has NO state on that turn's first round → this used
    to return 0 → micro_compact's prefix guard went OFF → it compacted cold
    history the gateway STILL had cached from the previous turn (within TTL) →
    the whole prefix was rewritten → guaranteed miss re-billing ~all of it.
    (Proven: fresh-thread round-1 rewrote 24 prefix msgs / ~72k tokens on a
    real conv; same-thread rounds were byte-stable.) The cached prefix is a
    CONVERSATION fact that outlives any one thread, so when the current
    thread's entry is missing/cold we fall back to the MAX boundary any warm
    sibling-thread entry for the SAME conv holds. Raising the floor is
    cache-SAFE by construction: it only ever PROTECTS more messages from
    compaction (never fewer), so it can never itself cause a miss — it just
    stops the turn-boundary rewrite. Messages are append-only within a conv,
    so the prior turn's boundary is a valid prefix of the current turn.
