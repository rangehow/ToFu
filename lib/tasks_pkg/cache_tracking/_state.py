"""Cache-state singleton + lifecycle (SHARED MUTABLE STATE).

This submodule owns the ONE authoritative ``_cache_states`` dict, its
``_cache_lock``, and the ``CacheState`` class. Every other submodule in the
``cache_tracking`` package imports these by reference from here — there is
exactly one copy of the state, so ``from lib.tasks_pkg.cache_tracking import
_cache_states`` returns the SAME object the internal functions mutate.

Also owns the state-eviction helpers (``cleanup_cache_state`` /
``cleanup_stale_cache_states``) and the tools-registry latch release. The L2
ROI flush on eviction is delegated to ``_roi._emit_l2_roi`` via a LAZY import
inside the functions to keep the dependency direction clean (``_roi`` imports
this module for the state; this module only reaches into ``_roi`` at call
time, never at import time).

    ``_cache_states`` is keyed per ``(conv_id, thread)``. A new user turn runs
    on a fresh ``run_task`` thread → a fresh ``CacheState`` with
    ``call_count == 0``, so the within-thread read baseline
    (``prev.last_cache_read_tokens``) is 0 on that turn's round-1. The break
    classifier tolerates that (it gates on ``call_count > 0``), but the
    write-breakdown then had NO read baseline for round-1 and defaulted the
    whole ``cache_write`` to the benign ``contextWrite`` — even when the
    PREVIOUS turn's cached prefix was partly evicted and re-billed this round.
    That is the round-1 mislabel: an evicted-tail re-bill wearing the
    "first-cache warm-up" hat.

    This returns the most-recently-updated SIBLING state's
    ``last_cache_read_tokens`` for the same conversation — the previous turn's
    final cached-prefix read, carried across the thread boundary — so the
    write-breakdown can classify a round-1 read drop honestly.

    CRUCIAL: the CURRENT thread's own entry is EXCLUDED. ``detect_cache_break``
    runs before the write-breakdown each round and has already advanced this
    thread's entry (``call_count`` bumped, ``last_cache_read_tokens`` set to
    THIS round's read). Including it would return this round's own read →
    ``read_drop`` collapses to 0 and the fix is a no-op. So we skip the entry
    whose thread id is the caller's; the remaining ``call_count > 0`` entries
    are prior turns (or, under swarm fan-out, concurrent agents — acceptable
    for a display-only baseline that only feeds a turn's round-1).

    Best-effort: returns 0 on any miss. Reuses the existing state + lock, so no
