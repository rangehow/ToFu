    NOTE (2026-04-10): A/B tested — cache contention between different
    conversations does NOT exist on Anthropic. Per-round cache_read is
    identical between solo and interleaved modes. The cache is keyed on
    exact prefix bytes, so different conversations have different keys
    and cannot evict each other.

    This function is retained for diagnostics/logging only (e.g., to
    report how many conversations are active on the same model), but
    should NOT be used to explain cache misses.
