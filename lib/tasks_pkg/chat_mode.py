"""lib/tasks_pkg/chat_mode.py — Canonical two-tier chat-mode derivation.

Tofu's toolbar collapses to ONE user-facing dial with two tiers:

    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  chat    — the everyday all-rounder (the default).  Full default   │
    │            tool set: web search + fetch + read + code execution +  │
    │            memory + todo + scheduler.                              │
    │  studio  — a project/repo is attached; the project tool family     │
    │            (list_dir/grep/write/apply_diff/run_command/…) replaces │
    │            the standalone code_exec tool, plus coordination tools. │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

History
-------
Earlier this was a THREE-tier dial (``air`` / ``pro`` / ``studio``).  ``air``
was a lean "cheapest, fewest tools" tier and ``pro`` the full all-rounder —
but the two overlapped (both are the project-LESS chat surface, differing only
in how many tools attach), which only burdened the user with a choice that
did not map to a distinct task.  They were merged into a single ``chat`` tier
(carrying the old ``pro`` full tool set).  Old conversations that persisted
``chatMode='air'`` or ``'pro'`` are normalised forward to ``'chat'`` so they
load unchanged.  The ``is_lean_mode`` seam is kept (now always False) because a
future "auto-retract tools for simple turns" feature will reuse it.

Single source of truth
-----------------------
``chatMode`` is the ONLY new wire field (camelCase, like every other cfg key).
This module is the ONE place that expands it into the pre-existing atomic
flags (``searchMode`` / ``codeExecEnabled`` / ``memoryEnabled`` / …).  The
frontend mirrors :func:`chat_mode_defaults` verbatim in
``static/js/main/main_toolbar_ui.js`` (``_CHAT_MODE_DEFAULTS``); a parity test
(``tests/test_chat_mode_parity.py``) asserts the two tables are byte-equal so
the two ends can never silently drift.

Authority rules (mirrors ``lib/agent_core/profiles.apply_profile``)
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Explicit ``chatMode`` is authoritative.**  When the request carries a
  valid ``cfg['chatMode']``, the derived flags OVERRIDE the atomic flags —
  the high-level intent wins, so the UI dial and the resolved tool set can
  never disagree.
* **Absent ``chatMode`` ⇒ byte-identical legacy behaviour.**  Headless callers
  and old clients that send atomic flags without a ``chatMode`` are left
  completely untouched (no override).  ``studio`` is never inferred onto them —
  a project is still gated purely on ``projectPath`` downstream.
* **``studio`` ⟺ a project is attached.**  ``chatMode='studio'`` sets the
  everyday defaults; the project TOOLS still switch on only when
  ``projectPath`` is non-empty (resolved downstream).  This keeps the
  "click Studio → pick a project → only THEN in studio" flow honest.
