"""Number of most-recent tool results to keep uncompressed.
Everything older is archived to DB and replaced with a placeholder.

2026-04-19: Raised 30 → 60 to reduce compaction aggressiveness. Most
SWE-bench-style tasks complete in 20-40 tool calls; doubling the hot
tail keeps them fully uncompressed. Normal chats rarely exceed 60 either.

2026-06-07: Lowered 60 → 40. The dspro 8-arm compaction A/B
(maps_workdir_pro8b) showed OpenCode's more active cold-output pruning
cut input tokens ~10% at the lowest cost/solve with no resolve-rate
regression vs the 60-keep `tofu` arm. Keeping the count-based hot tail
(not token-based) but tightening it to 40 captures most of that saving
while still covering the 20-40-tool-call body of typical SWE-bench runs.

2026-07 (single-giant-turn review): DELIBERATELY KEPT count-based (40), NOT
switched to the token-budget ``adaptive_hot_tail``. The accumulation vector
that motivated a token cap — a burst of L0-exempt ``read_files`` (each ~50–65k
tokens) sitting inside the 40-count hot tail growing past the window before a
turn ends — is now closed STRUCTURALLY at L2/L3, not by retuning L1:
  • L2 ``execute_compact_tool`` folds cold tool-call ROUNDS out of the
    preserved (in-flight) turn (``_fold_recent_intra_turn``), and its trigger
    (``_should_force_compact``) is TOKEN-based — so a hot tail that is large in
    BYTES still trips L2 and gets folded regardless of the L1 count.
  • L3 ``_head_truncate`` is now tool-pairing-safe, the bounded last resort.
So the count-based L1 tail is a cheap, cache-stable, well-understood default
whose worst case is now bounded by the token-aware layers above it. Switching
L1's default to ``adaptive_hot_tail`` is a hyperparameter change (§10.1)
gated on a fresh A/B — it remains available as an opt-in arm
(``compaction.steps=['adaptive_hot_tail']``) but is NOT the default, because
the overflow risk it targeted no longer depends on the L1 count."""

NOT lose the concurrent work. The engine reloads after summarizing, verifies
the folded prefix is byte-unchanged, rebuilds over the CURRENT tail, and CAS-es
on the CURRENT ``updated_at``.

Why a TIME budget, not a fixed retry COUNT: the reconcile window is now
LLM-free, but on a multi-MB conversation one reload→rebuild→CAS pass still
costs tens-to-hundreds of ms (DB read + json.loads + sorted-key fingerprint +
build_search_text + json_dumps_pg + UPDATE). Under a real write burst

punched through — every pass loses to a fresh tail write → the user sees a 409
on the "must never fail" path. A time budget instead keeps retrying against the
