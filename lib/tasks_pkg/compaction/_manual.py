"""Layer 2 (manual) — user-triggered active context compaction (`/compact`).

Unlike the automatic L2 path (``_layer2.execute_compact_tool``), which is
*ephemeral* — it rewrites the in-flight request ``messages`` list once per
round and the raw ``conversations.messages`` in the DB is never shrunk — this
module implements the **persistent** manual compaction the user asks for with
a button: it replaces the old history in ``conversations.messages`` itself with
a single summary message, so every subsequent turn loads a small context.

It REUSES the L2 summary engine verbatim (``_generate_query_aware_summary`` +
the 9-section system prompt + objective-anchor protection + recently-accessed
files). It does NOT rewrite any summary logic.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
⚠️  HARD CONSTRAINT (see docs/MANUAL_COMPACTION_DESIGN.md §4.1): boundary
    computation and application MUST stay in the SAME index space.

    ``_transform_messages`` (the api-form projection) is length/order-changing:
    one raw assistant row with N ``toolRounds`` expands into many api messages,
    endpoint sessions collapse, same-role rows merge.  So an index computed on
    the api-form list CANNOT be mapped 1:1 back to the raw
    ``conversations.messages`` list.  Slicing the raw list with an api-space
    index would split a tool round → orphan ``tool`` messages / a broken
    tool_call/result pair → HTTP 400.

    THE RULE — read-project, write-raw, compute-in-raw-space:
      * turn / boundary / anchor are defined on the RAW stored shape; the
        boundary ALWAYS lands on a raw ``user`` index and slicing is on raw.
      * per-turn token estimation is RAW-AWARE (``_raw_estimate_tokens``):
        it projects the turn slice through ``_transform_messages`` then
        ``_estimate_total_tokens`` — it does NOT call ``_estimate_msg_tokens``
        on a raw assistant row (that is api-form-aware and blind to
        ``toolRounds``, so it would massively under-count a tool-heavy turn).
      * ``_transform_messages`` is used ONLY read-only, at two points: to count
        a turn's tokens and to build the summary-input text.  Its output index
        is never used to slice the raw list.

Public surface:
  * ``compact_conversation_now`` — DB orchestrator (load → plan → archive →
    summarize → rewrite → persist).  Idle-only (caller gates on activeTaskId).
  * ``plan_manual_compaction``   — pure: computes system_end / boundary /
    anchor / old-region / reserve-region.  No DB, no LLM.
  * ``apply_manual_compaction``  — pure: rebuilds the raw message list.
  * ``_raw_turn_boundary`` / ``_raw_estimate_tokens`` — the raw-space helpers.

    # ── RECONCILE + PERSIST ──
    # Root cause of the "manual /compact always 409 on an active conversation":
    # the summary LLM call takes seconds, during which a sibling agent turn
    # appends/patches the conversation TAIL. The old code CAS-ed on the LOAD-time
    # ``updated_at`` guarding the WHOLE row, so ANY concurrent write — even one
    # that only touched the preserved tail and left the folded region untouched —
    # lost the CAS and returned `stale`/409. But compaction and "the tail grew a
    # few rounds" are SEMANTICALLY MERGEABLE: the summary only consumes the FOLDED
    # region (raw indices ``< watermark``); the tail is preserved verbatim either
    # way.
    #
    # So instead of a single-shot CAS on stale state we: reload the CURRENT
    # messages, verify the folded region is byte-unchanged (the ONLY thing that
    # would invalidate the summary), rebuild over the CURRENT tail (so no
    # concurrently-appended turn is lost), and CAS on the CURRENT ``updated_at``.
    # We retry within a WALL-CLOCK BUDGET (not a fixed count): the window is now
    # LLM-free but each pass still costs tens-to-hundreds of ms on a multi-MB
    # conversation, and a real write burst (~1–2 PATCHes/sec) can punch through a
    # small fixed count → a 409 on the must-never-fail path. Retrying against the
    # ever-fresher tail until it lands makes a bounded burst un-surfaceable as a
    # failure. Only a change WITHIN the folded region is a true conflict → stale;
    # exhausting the budget also yields stale (defensive, not expected in prod).
