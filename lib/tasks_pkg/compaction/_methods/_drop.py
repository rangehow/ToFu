    messages are pure mechanical tool activity (no natural-language
    synthesis).

    A *turn* = ``[user request, ...assistant/tool work]``.  Whole-turn
    eviction necessarily drops the turn's user request too — that is the
    nature of structural turn-drop (it is why Layer 2 *summarizes* before
    dropping).  This standalone variant is therefore lossy by design and
    is opt-in: it targets cold turns that were pure exploration
    (assistant emitted only tool calls, no prose decision/explanation),
    on the theory that such turns carry no reasoning the model still
    needs.  Methods that must preserve the request should pair this with
    a summary (see :func:`summarize_oldest_turn`).

    The :class:`MessageEditor` guarantees we never drop the in-flight
    turn or a turn overlapping the cache prefix, and whole-turn deletion
    can't orphan a tool_call↔tool pair.  Real structural methods
    (relevance-based eviction, etc.) plug in the same way.
