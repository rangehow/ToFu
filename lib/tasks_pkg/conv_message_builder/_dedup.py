def _dedup_duplicate_user_messages(src: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
    """Drop duplicate user rows that represent the SAME logical send turn.

    Root cause this defends against: during the synchronous send-path
    auto-translate window, a racing conversation sync (the "rescue
    local-only conv" PUT, another browser tab, or a /chat/send retry) can
    plant the optimistic frontend copy of a user message into the DB while
    the server is still building/translating its own authoritative copy.
    Both rows share the SAME ``timestamp`` (the frontend payload timestamp
    flows through ``build_user_msg_from_payload``). A stale aborted task
    can similarly resurrect a just-truncated user turn.

    ``append_user_msg_idempotent`` reconciles this at the *write* site, but
    a row already corrupted before that fix shipped — or planted by a writer
    that bypasses the helper — still lives in the DB. Without this pass,
    ``_merge_consecutive_same_role`` would *concatenate* the two user rows
    (or carry both across an empty assistant), doubling the user's text in
    the LLM context.

    Strategy: keep only the LAST user row in any run of consecutive user
    rows that share a ``timestamp`` (the server-translated copy is appended
    after the optimistic one, so the last wins — it carries the
    authoritative ``content`` + translation fields). Endpoint-mode user rows
    (``_isEndpointReview``) are never collapsed — they legitimately repeat.

    Args:
        src: Raw conversation messages (mutated copy returned, input untouched).

    Returns:
        A new list with duplicate same-timestamp user rows collapsed.
