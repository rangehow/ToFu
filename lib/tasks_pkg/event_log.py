"""Persisted SSE event log — durable Last-Event-ID replay.

Every event that goes through ``manager.append_event`` is mirrored into the
``task_events`` table.  This decouples event replay from in-memory task
state, so SSE reconnection survives:

  * task removal by ``cleanup_old_tasks`` (1h threshold)
  * server restart
  * cross-process readers (when a future deployment fans tasks across
    multiple Flask workers)

Two read paths exist on the SSE handler:

  1. **Hot path** — when the task is still in ``tasks`` dict, replay reads
     directly from ``task['events']`` (no DB hit, lower latency).
  2. **Cold path** — when the task is gone (cleanup or restart), the SSE
     handler falls back to ``read_events`` here.

Pruning is opportunistic: every Nth ``append_event`` call performs a TTL
sweep on the table, deleting rows whose task is terminal and older than
``EVENT_TTL_MS``.  This keeps the table bounded without a background
thread.

Note on persistence semantics: every event (including each delta) is
persisted as its own row on arrival.  No in-memory buffering, no
coalescing — the previous "250 ms delta coalesce" behaviour was removed
in 2026-05 because cold-replay required exact-cursor reconstruction.
``flush_pending`` is retained as a no-op for API compatibility with the
sole caller in ``manager.append_event``; it does not need to be called
by new code.
