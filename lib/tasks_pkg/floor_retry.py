"""Floor-collapse identical-resend mitigation for the prompt-cache write-
visibility race.

Background
=========
A fraction of rounds report ``cache_read`` pinned at the static system+tools
FLOOR (the whole conversation body re-billed as ``cache_creation``) even though
the request's wire bytes are byte-IDENTICAL to a previously-cached request and
the block geometry is inside Anthropic's ~20-block lookback. Real-gateway
replay of the SAME bytes four times collapses DIFFERENT rounds at 13-40% — i.e.
it is a SERVER-SIDE stochastic cache-write-visibility race (Anthropic SDK
#1451), not a client layout bug. See docs/CACHE_GATEWAY_STOCHASTIC_REPORT.md.

Because the collapse is independent per request, RESENDING the identical
byte-stable body re-rolls the dice and usually hits the now-visible cache write
— the harness proved this drives the effective floor% toward zero (mrsfs9d6
20%->0%). This module is the production wiring of that mitigation.

Discipline (mirrors the TOFU_CACHE_MID_MODE=drop rollout)
=========================================================
  * ENV-GATED, default OFF (``TOFU_CACHE_FLOOR_RETRY``) — no behaviour change
    until an operator opts in, and instant rollback by unsetting it.
  * Only fires on a BYTE-STABLE floor-collapse (the wire prefix is proven
    identical to the previous round). A resend on a body the client actually
    changed would be a wasted call, so it is refused.
  * CAPPED resends (``TOFU_CACHE_FLOOR_RETRY_MAX``, default 1) — cost is bounded.
  * 503/throttle-AWARE: a resend that raises a rate-limit/throttle error stops
    the loop immediately (do not pile retries onto an already-throttled gateway;
    that is what limited the harness mrt1ijef arm to 11.8%).

Public API
==========
  * ``floor_retry_enabled()`` — env gate.
  * ``floor_retry_max()`` — capped resend count.
  * ``is_floor_collapse(usage)`` — the read-at-floor + big-write predicate.
  * ``wire_prefix_stable(usage)`` — True when this round's usage carries the
    proof its wire prefix was byte-identical to the previous round (safe to
    resend). Consults the live cache-tracking state, non-destructively.

    The proof lives in ``usage['_wire_fp']`` (the post-translation fingerprint
    captured in prepare_request). We compare it against the conversation's
    PREVIOUS stored fingerprint held by the cache-tracking state — WITHOUT
    mutating that state (``detect_cache_break`` is the sole writer, called
    later in the same round). Absent a fingerprint we conservatively return
    False (never resend on unproven-stable bytes).

    ``wire_fp`` (``canonical_messages``) is deliberately LOSSY — it is the SAME
    signal ``detect_cache_break`` uses to EARN the "server-side stochastic"
    label rather than reach it by elimination, which is exactly the collapse
    class a resend recovers. A false "stable" would at worst waste one capped
    resend; a false "unstable" only forgoes the mitigation — both safe.
