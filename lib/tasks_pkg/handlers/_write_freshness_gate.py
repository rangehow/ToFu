"""Write-freshness gate for the project write tools.

Companion to the read-before-edit gate (``_read_gate.py``). That gate proves
"you read this file at SOME point in this conversation"; THIS gate proves
"it has not changed SINCE". On a shared working tree the classic clobber
is: conversation A reads a file at T0, thinks for many rounds, and at T2
writes from its stale memory — silently discarding sibling B's T1 change.

The check is an optimistic-concurrency token (``lib/write_freshness.py``):
successful reads AND writes record a fingerprint per
``(conv_key, abs_path)`` — content-addressed (blake2b) for files ≤ 4 MiB,
``(mtime_ns, size)`` above — and a write whose recorded fingerprint no
longer matches the disk is refused with a re-read instruction. The content
signal matters because this deployment's FUSE mount has 1-SECOND mtime
granularity: ``(mtime_ns, size)`` alone is blind to same-second same-size
edits (measured; see lib/write_freshness.py).

Deliberate scope (fail-open everywhere else):

  * NO token → allowed. Blind full-rewrite flows keep working; the
    read-before-edit gate owns the "must read first" axis for edit tools.
  * File VANISHED since the token → allowed (creation semantics; the edit
    tools' own "File not found" path is the clearer error).
  * Check failure (resolution error, store error) → allowed, logged at
    WARNING. A guard must never become an availability risk.

Only a positively-known STALE token refuses, because that is the exact
clobber pattern. Env: ``TOFU_WRITE_FRESHNESS_GATE=0`` disables.
