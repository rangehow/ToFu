"""MCP tool handler — dispatches tool calls to MCP servers via the bridge.

Unlike other handlers that register for specific tool names, MCP tools are
dynamic: their names are only known at runtime after connecting to MCP servers.
The handler is registered as a **fallback** on the ToolRegistry that catches
any ``mcp__*`` prefixed tool name.

Registration pattern:
  - We don't use @tool_registry.handler() because MCP tool names are dynamic.
  - Instead, we extend ToolRegistry.lookup() to fall back to the MCP handler
    for any tool name starting with ``mcp__``.
