    A per-task opt-out (``task['config']['disableModelFallback'] == True``)

    for controlled experiments: without it, a transient primary-model
    error silently switches the round to the global fallback model

    measure ONLY the requested model. With it, the round simply errors

    Replaces the old "empty stop on round 0 ⇒ content_filter" heuristic, which
    was too aggressive: it declared a terminal content-policy block (NO retry)
    on any 200-OK ``finish=stop`` that produced no visible content. But a
    GENUINE policy violation arrives as :class:`ContentFilterError` (HTTP 450),
    handled separately and terminal. A plain empty stop is a TRANSIENT gateway
    artifact — proven by ``debug/repro_conv_empty_stop.py``, which replays the
    exact large request that empty-stopped in production and gets clean content
    6/6 times.

    The stream layer (``lib/llm/_sse_core.py``) only sets the
    ``_empty_stop`` / ``_stream_anomaly`` flags when ``finish=stop AND not
    content AND chunk_count > 0`` — so a whitespace-only body (``content`` is
    truthy) or a zero-chunk clean-``[DONE]`` close slips through UNFLAGGED and
    the empty_stop retry bucket (cap 2, in ``analyse_stream_result``) never
    fires. This helper closes that gap: when the round is a bare empty stop on
    the FIRST round that the stream layer did NOT already flag, it sets the
    ``_empty_stop`` + ``_stream_anomaly`` flags on ``usage`` (mutated in place)
    so ``analyse_stream_result`` retries it via the empty_stop / zero_byte
    bucket. Only after those retries are exhausted does it surface honestly as
    ``abnormal_stop`` — never as a fabricated content-policy block.

    Returns ``True`` iff it flagged this round for retry (so the caller can log
    it). Round > 0 is left alone (empty content after tool calls is legitimate).
