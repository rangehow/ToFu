"""Task lifecycle management — creation, events, persistence, cleanup, streaming.

★ Migrated to ``lib.task_runtime.TaskRuntime`` 2026-05-22 (last of the
five legacy registries). The module-level ``tasks`` / ``tasks_lock``
names remain exported because 47 import sites across routes/, lib/, and
tests/ reference them directly. They now alias the runtime's internal
storage. All custom behaviour (phase tracking, persistent event log,
freshness-guard `_conv_latest_task` index, content_lock, etc.) is
preserved on top of the runtime by augmenting the task dict after
``runtime.create()``.

# ── Persisted-payload trimming: drop transient/diagnostic bloat ──────────
#
# Three fields balloon the persisted conversation JSON without any value once
# a turn is done — they are transient streaming buffers or backend-only
# diagnostics that no render path reads. Left in place they inflate a single
# conversation to 100+ MB, so the browser exhausts memory the moment it loads
# and renders it (proven: mr80gsd8rywph9 = 121 MB, dominated by usage._wire_fp).
# We strip them at the DB persist boundary (and mirror the strip on the
# frontend PUT + IndexedDB cache) so the authoritative store never carries them.
#
#   1. usage._wire_fp / _wire_static — the post-translation wire fingerprint
#      (a ~226 KB canonicalized-message LIST per round). Captured in
#      lib/llm/_sse_core.py purely for same-run cache-miss diagnosis by
#      lib/tasks_pkg/cache_tracking.py, which keeps its OWN in-memory copy
#      (prev.wire_fp). NO frontend code reads usage._wire_fp — grep-verified.
#   2. toolRounds[]._partialOutput — the live run_command terminal buffer that
#      grows during streaming. Once the round is done the authoritative output
#      lives in results[0].output / toolContent; _partialOutput is dead weight
#      (18 MB in mqxbemdr7asicp while toolContent was 2 KB). The render path
#      uses toolContent, never _partialOutput, on a completed round.
#
# These two are dropped unconditionally on persist. Inline base64 image URIs
# (toolRounds[].results[].imageDataUris[].uri) are ALSO multi-MB but ARE the
# render source, so they are handled on the frontend cache side (strip from the
# IndexedDB copy, keep in the live/DB copy) — not here.

# usage sub-keys that are backend-only stream diagnostics (never read by any
# render path). _wire_fp is the giant (~226 KB/round); the rest are tiny but
# equally value-free once persisted, so drop the whole diagnostic set.
