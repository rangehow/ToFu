    This answers a DIFFERENT question from ``status == 'running'``, and the
    difference is the ms34u49egqwhug incident (2026-07-27): the orchestrator
    flips the parent to ``status='done'`` at the terminal seam
    (``orchestrator/_finalize.py``) and only THEN, in the same synchronous
    call stack, runs ``maybe_run_autopilot`` — which executes an entire VU
    turn that can take minutes. During that window ``status`` correctly means
    "the stream body is finished", but the conversation is emphatically NOT
    idle: an autopilot turn is mid-flight and the user must see a live
    indicator and be able to stop it.

    Historically only ONE of the three readers of that fact honoured it:

      * the SSE live-tick (``lib/chat_dispatch.py``) held its LATE-done while
        ``task['_finalize_started_at']`` was fresh — which is why the stream
        stayed open and the transcript kept updating;
      * the busy projection (``snapshot_running_by_conv`` → the sidebar dot
        and the composer Send/Stop button) did not — so the UI reported
        "generation complete" while 8 LLM rounds ran;
      * the reconnect view (``/api/chat/active``) does not either, but that is
        a deliberate and separate concern (reconnecting a carrier's SSE would
        birth a stuck bubble) — discoverability, not busy-ness.

    Rather than teach the busy reader a second, divergent notion of "running",
    this predicate is the ONE place that definition lives.

    Two ways a task carries work in flight:

      1. ``status == 'running'`` and not aborted — the ordinary case. NOTE
         this ALREADY covers a live VU carrier, which is a running task in
         its own right; the projection's job is merely not to filter it out.
      2. a FRESH ``_finalize_started_at`` latch — covers ONLY the sliver
         between the parent's terminal flip and its carrier's registration
         (see :func:`_vu_window_secs`). Everything after the carrier exists
         is covered by term 1 via the carrier itself, NOT by this timer.

    ``aborted`` always wins: the instant the user presses Stop (or supersede
    fires) the conversation must read idle so the composer returns to Send.

    """Return one entry per CONVERSATION with genuinely-live running work.

    Used by the self-update restart guard to refuse a process re-exec that
    would kill sibling conversations' in-flight work. A restart is an
    unconditional ``os.execv`` of the whole server, so EVERY running task
    dies with it — this lets the caller detect that and require an explicit
    override.

    Three filters make the count reflect reality rather than registry cruft, so
    the guard never blocks a restart for work that is not actually running:

      * **Carrier filter (same judge as ``/api/chat/active``).** A non-streaming
        CARRIER/HOLDER (``is_carrier_task``: the autopilot VU sub-task or an
        inline reporter holder) is ``status='running'`` while it executes but is
        invisible to the frontend by design (the reconnect endpoint hides it,
        the sidebar never lights a dot for it). Counting it made the restart
        dialog report "N conversations running" that the user could see nowhere.
      * **Activity filter (same judge as the reaper).** A task whose BOTH
        liveness clocks (``_t_last_event`` and ``_dispatch_heartbeat``) have
        been silent past ``_stuck_task_max_silent_secs()`` is WEDGED — the exact
        signal ``reap_stuck_running_tasks`` uses to force-fail it. Such a task
        is excluded here too, so a just-died zombie does not block a restart for
        the whole 30-minute reaper window (it would otherwise be counted until
        the next reaper tick flips it terminal). ``status=='running'`` alone is
        NOT liveness — it is exactly the false signal that produced the "63
        other conversations have running tasks" phantom. If the reaper is
        disabled (threshold ``<=0``) no task is treated as wedged (mirrors the
        reaper), so behaviour is unchanged there.
      * **Per-conversation dedup.** A single conversation (autopilot especially)
        can spawn dozens of tasks; counting per-task turned "3 busy convs" into
        "63". Entries are keyed by ``convId`` so the count is the number of
        distinct conversations a restart would interrupt. Tasks with no convId
        (headless / external callers) are NOT collapsed — each stays its own
        entry keyed on its task id.

    Args:
        exclude_conv_id: When set, running tasks belonging to this conversation
            are omitted (the caller triggering the restart doesn't count its
            own conversation against itself).

    Returns:
        A list of ``{'taskId', 'convId', 'elapsed'}`` dicts, one per distinct
        live conversation (representative = the earliest-created live task of
        that conv). Best-effort snapshot taken under ``tasks_lock``.

def snapshot_running_by_conv(user_id: str = '') -> dict[str, list[str]]:
    """Return ``{conv_id: [task_id, ...]}`` for every non-carrier running task.

    P1 of pt_conv_state_ssot: the single read the ``notify_conv_changed`` seam
    uses to project the busy fact into the outbound frame. This is the SSOT
    for "which conversations have live tasks", replacing the settings-derived
    ``activeTaskId`` (single value) heuristic that made cross-device sidebars
    disagree.

    Multi-tenant scoping (pt_ab42421158214591, 2026-07-25): when ``user_id``
    is set to a non-empty string, only tasks whose ``task['_userId']`` matches
    are included — closes the multi-tenant leak where user B's tab would
    otherwise receive a snapshot built from user A's registry. Empty string
    (default) returns EVERY non-carrier running task regardless of owner —
    this is the single-user / personal-install / pre-auth default, and also
    the fallback for write-path callers that have no request context to
    resolve a user from.

    Semantics — deliberately DIFFERENT from ``list_running_tasks``:

      * **NO activity/wedge filter.** A task whose event/heartbeat clocks have
        gone silent is still "supposed to be running" from the sidebar's POV
        — the reaper (~30 min) is what decides it is finally stuck, at which
        point it writes a terminal row and this snapshot drops it naturally.
        The restart-guard needs strict liveness ("is anyone actually working
        right now"); the busy-dot needs the broader "is it supposed to be
        working" so a temporarily-quiet task does not extinguish the dot and
        then re-light it 100 ms later. Two different questions → two
        different helpers.
      * **Carrier filter (same as list_running_tasks).** Autopilot VU
        sub-tasks and inline reporter carriers must not surface — they
        have no user-visible bubble and would light a permanent phantom
        sidebar dot.
      * **Empty-convId tasks dropped.** A task with no ``convId`` cannot be
        projected into any sidebar row; it stays invisible.
      * **Aborted / non-running dropped.** Once ``t['aborted']`` flips true
        the dot should extinguish immediately, so the client sees Send (not
        Stop) the instant supersede fires.
      * **Multiple tasks per conv preserved.** ``list_running_tasks`` dedups
        to one representative per conv for the restart guard's counting; we
        do NOT — the client needs the FULL set so ``_reconnectServerTaskIfIdle``
        can rejoin any of them, and later drift-check equality is strict.

    Read-only. Snapshot taken under ``tasks_lock``; safe to call from any
    thread. Ordering within each conv's list is registry-iteration order
    (approximately creation order) — deterministic per-process but not
    guaranteed across replicas. Clients treat the list as a SET.
