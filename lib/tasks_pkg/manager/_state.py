"""Shared singleton state for the ``lib.tasks_pkg.manager`` facade package.

This module is the SINGLE HOME of the process-wide task state that every
manager sub-module reads/writes:

  * ``_chat_runtime`` — the backing :class:`~lib.task_runtime.TaskRuntime`.
  * ``tasks`` / ``tasks_lock`` — ALIASES to the runtime's internal storage
    (``_chat_runtime._tasks`` / ``_chat_runtime._lock``). 47+ import sites across
    routes/, lib/, and tests/ reference these directly and MUST observe THE SAME
    object, so they are defined exactly once here and re-exported unchanged from
    the package ``__init__``.
  * ``_conv_latest_task`` / ``_conv_latest_task_lock`` — the freshness-guard
    conv→latest-task index + its lock.
  * ``_LATEST_KIND`` / ``_LATEST_TTL`` — cross-replica supersede-index knobs.
  * ``CHECKPOINT_MIN_DELTA_CHARS`` — partial-checkpoint coalescing threshold.
  * ``_record_latest_task`` / ``_latest_task_for_conv`` — the index accessors.

Keeping all of this in one leaf module (no sibling imports) means the aliasing
identity is preserved and there is no risk of two modules each minting their own
copy of the shared dict.

# the shared runtime_state_store: under inproc the local dict stays the fast
# authoritative path (byte-identical to before); under redis the store is the
# fleet source of truth. The actual cross-replica ABORT of the superseded task
# routes to its owning replica via taskId affinity (LB concern) — this index

# Minimum content+thinking growth (chars) since the last conversations.messages
# write before a mid-stream partial checkpoint bothers rewriting that whole
# O(conv-size) JSON blob again. Small deltas are COALESCED (skipped), not
# dropped: the delta is measured against the DB row, so a skip leaves the row
# stale and the NEXT delta's measured growth includes the skipped chars — it is
# inherently cumulative and always flushes once growth crosses the threshold.
# The per-task task_results checkpoint (the cheap blob) is written EVERY
# checkpoint regardless, and the terminal _sync_result_to_conversation always
# writes the full final content — so the messages row is a derived mirror that
# may lag by < this many chars mid-stream and always converges at completion.
# The reconnect / poll-fallback reload path reads task_results + the task_events
# log (never this row) so it is unaffected. 0 disables coalescing (write on
# every delta — the legacy behaviour). Override with CHECKPOINT_MIN_DELTA_CHARS.
