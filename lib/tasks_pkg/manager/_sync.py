"""Conversation synchronization — writing task results/partials back into the
``conversations.messages`` JSON, plus the post-terminal fan-out helpers
(proactive-status update, queued-message dispatch, project-summary refresh) and
the settle-time orphan-placeholder reconcile.

These functions carry the freshness-guard + CAS-retry discipline that keeps a
stale/superseded task from clobbering a newer task's answer. They read shared
state (``_conv_latest_task``) and the low-level persist helpers from sibling
modules; ``_sync_result_to_conversation`` / ``_assign_message_ids`` are
monkeypatched by tests, so they remain facade-reachable.

# message under the SAME key (an underscore field, exactly like
# ``_relatedConversations`` / ``_memoryPrefetch``). CRITICAL INVARIANT: they must
# NEVER be folded into ``toolRounds`` / ``segments`` — those are the wire-replay /
# prefix-cache source (``_reconstruct_tool_call_messages`` collapses the whole
# assistant turn to a lossy summary if any round lacks toolCallId/toolContent,
# which both breaks tool-turn continuation AND shifts the wire prefix). The wire
# builders (``_build_assistant_messages`` / ``assemble_segments``) read only
# ``role`` / ``content`` / ``toolRounds`` / ``segments`` — never underscore
# fields — so persisting these is provably wire-neutral. The frontend rebuilds
# the in-timeline inject chip from these at render time; the synthetic row is
# NEVER written back into the DB ``toolRounds``.

    target, and ``_sync_result_to_conversation`` skips its normal write (no

    'delete' for a bare empty trailing assistant) at TASK-END, keyed by taskId.
