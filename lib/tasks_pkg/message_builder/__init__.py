"""Message-building helpers — URL prefetch injection and tool-history restoration.

Extracted from ``orchestrator.py`` to isolate the logic that mutates the
``messages`` list before the main LLM tool loop begins.

This package was split from the former single-file
``lib/tasks_pkg/message_builder.py`` for readability. The public import
surface is unchanged, so every ``from lib.tasks_pkg.message_builder import X``
keeps working byte-identically:

  • :func:`inject_prefetched_urls`  — see ``_prefetch``
  • :func:`inject_tool_history`     — see ``_tool_history``
