"""Abort-at-round-start gate: break the stream loop on a pre-round abort.

Extracted 2026-07-31 (pt_03f4cdf1 slice 23) from
``lib/tasks_pkg/orchestrator/_run.py`` run_task stream loop.

Runs at the very TOP of every round, before ROUND_START is emitted.
When ``task['aborted']`` is set:

1. Stamps ``rs.abort_phase`` ('loop_start_round_<n>') and
   ``rs.exit_reason`` ('aborted_at_round_<n>').
2. Logs a DEBUG line with the abort-signal age (from
   ``task['_abort_timestamp']``, 'unknown' when unset) and the
   content length so far — the forensic trail for abort-latency
   postmortems.
3. Returns True so the caller breaks. NO ROUND_END is emitted here:
   the round never opened (no ROUND_START was emitted for it), so
   there is nothing to pair — the PREVIOUS round's end was already
   emitted at its own exit (RENDER_CONTRACT Phase 3).

Returns False when the task is not aborted and the round may open.
