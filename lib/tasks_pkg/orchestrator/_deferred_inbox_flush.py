# HOT_PATH — this leaf is called per stream-loop iteration.
"""Post-LLM deferred peer + steer inbox flush.

Extracted 2026-07-28 (pt_03f4cdf1 slice 12) from
``lib.tasks_pkg.orchestrator._run.run_task``. The two flushes run
RIGHT AFTER a successful ``_llm_call_with_fallback`` return and
BEFORE the stream loop reads the resolved model onto the task.
They enforce the never-zero-and-never-double delivery invariants:

Peer flush
----------
The LLM call succeeded, so a peer message injected into ``messages``
this round WAS consumed by the model. NOW — atomically — emit the
``PEER_INBOX_INJECT`` chip (the in-timeline arrival marker) AND
delete the durable ``message_queue`` row(s) so ``dispatch_next_queued``
can't later re-dispatch them as a redundant fresh turn. If the task
aborted BEFORE this point, neither happened and the durable row
SURVIVED → it is re-dispatched later as a fresh turn (delivered late,
rendered exactly once — never zero, never double). Runs after a
fallback too (delivery still happened). Best-effort: a delete failure
only risks a rare double-delivery (reverse-race guard still applies),
never a loss.

Steer flush
-----------
Same discipline as the peer flush above: the LLM call succeeded, so
the human steer injected into ``messages`` this round WAS consumed by
the model. Emit the ``USER_STEER_INJECT`` chip now (delivery
confirmed) and accumulate a DISPLAY-ONLY sidecar record on the task
(``task['_userSteerInjects']``) so the sync layer can persist it onto
the assistant message as an underscore field — NEVER into
``toolRounds`` (that is the wire-replay / prefix-cache source; a
synthetic row there breaks tool-turn continuation and shifts wire
bytes). On an abort BEFORE this point the chip is never emitted and
the undelivered steer is salvaged back to the durable
``message_queue`` by finalize (see ``_finalize.py``) → re-dispatched
as a fresh turn, delivered exactly once.

VU sub-task carrier
-------------------
A VU sub-task runs with ``convId=''`` and carries the parent conv in
``task['_peer_drain_key']``. The dedup call MUST prefer that key over
``convId`` — the twin was enqueued under it — or a VU-issued peer
message rerolls as a fresh turn.

        Zero-based stream-loop round number; the chips carry

    tid
        8-char task-id prefix used for structured log context.
