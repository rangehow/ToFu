Split out of the monolithic ``orchestrator.py`` (facade-preserving).
Holds the post-loop finalizer ``_finalize_and_emit_done`` plus the
inter-round narration discard, suspicious-completion detector, tool-round
phase emitter, dangling-round sweep, whole-turn auto-retry, and the
sources-footer backstop.  ``run_task`` (in ``_run.py``) calls these.

# ── Suspicious-completion INTERCEPTION (act, not just warn) ───────────────
#
# WHY this exists (2026-07-28 09:51–10:45 incident): the sankuai gateway
# intermittently returned a 29-char canned greeting ("Hi! How can I help you
# today?") with ``finish_reason=stop`` for every Opus 5 request — 68 times,
# each carrying a real M-TraceId. Tasks that had just spent N rounds doing real
# tool work then had their TERMINAL round replaced by that greeting, and
# finalize persisted ``task['content']`` (the last round's 29 chars) over the
# accumulated deliverable. ``_check_suspicious_completion`` SAW it
# (``short_content_after_tool_calls`` fired 54×) — but only logged. Nothing
# stopped the overwrite.
#
# What is recoverable: ``_discard_pretool_prose`` zeroes ``task['content']``
# after every tool round, but the prose the model streamed ALONGSIDE those
# calls is kept verbatim on the tool round as ``assistantContent`` (see
# tool_dispatch/_parse.py). That is the accumulated inter-round work — the
# "已做的工作 + 阶段性结论" the user watched happen. When the terminal round is
# a suspicious short ``stop`` (the exact shape the detector already flags), we
# rebuild the delivered content from those snapshots instead of shipping the
# short residue, so the user gets the real accumulated work back.
#
# Gates (each one is a distinct no-false-positive boundary, all pinned by
# tests/test_suspicious_short_completion_guard.py):
#   * finish_reason == 'stop'   — only a completed turn is an overwrite
#     candidate (tool_use/aborted/error finishes are not "the model stopped");
#   * tool_call_happened        — no tool rounds means nothing accumulated;
#   * content is short (<50)    — mirrors the detector's own threshold, so the
#     interception fires on exactly the shape the detector flags, never on a
#     normal long answer (complement test);
#   * recovered narration is substantial (> accumulated chars) — a genuinely
#     short turn with no real prior prose has nothing to recover, so it is
#     left untouched (no mangling a real "好的。");
#   * not aborted               — a user Stop legitimately truncates the
#     accumulator and must never be "recovered" over.
