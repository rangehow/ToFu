"""Provider binding — hard provider pin + conversation-sticky routing.

Extracted 2026-08-01 (pt_03f4cdf1 slice 31) from ``run_task``'s pre-stream
prep. Runs ONCE per run_task invocation, right before Section 1 (config
resolution). Both binds are THREAD-LOCAL and cleared in run_task's finally
block (``_teardown.finalize_task_lane``) because worker threads are pooled
and reused.

Two bindings, one branch:

1. **Hard provider pin (multi-tenant isolation).** When this task was
   created from an inline ``provider`` block or a registered ``@prov_xxx``
   BYO endpoint, bind THIS worker thread to that provider so every LLM
   dispatch on it (main solve, L2/advanced compaction summaries, endpoint
   replan turns) can only pick that provider's slot — never silently fall
   back to an operator key and eat a 429. See
   ``lib/llm_dispatch/provider_pin.py``. BRANCH: only when
   ``task['_pinned_provider_id']`` is truthy.

2. **Conversation-sticky routing.** Bind this worker thread to the
   conversation so every LLM dispatch on it prefers the API key that last
   served this conv — keeping the Anthropic per-key prompt cache warm
   across rounds. Soft preference: the picker still falls back to a
   healthy key when the sticky one is cooled down. See
   ``lib/llm_dispatch/conv_affinity.py``. Called UNCONDITIONALLY — an
   empty convId clears whatever stale affinity the pooled thread carries
   from its previous task.
