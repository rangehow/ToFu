"""Per-round crash-recovery checkpoint + RENDER_CONTRACT round close.

Extracted 2026-07-31 (pt_03f4cdf1 slice 20) from
``lib/tasks_pkg/orchestrator/_run.py`` run_task stream loop.

Two steps run at the natural end of a tools-executed iteration,
AFTER the tool execution pipeline and the consecutive-timeout
circuit breaker:

1. **Crash-recovery checkpoint** (``checkpoint_task_partial``):
   persists current content/thinking to task_results + conversation
   so data survives a server crash. Throttled to at most once every
   5 seconds to avoid DB pressure. Failure is non-fatal (logged at
   WARNING with exc_info) — a checkpoint bug must never break an
   otherwise-healthy round.
2. **RENDER_CONTRACT Phase 3 round close**: emits
   ROUND_END(reason='tools') pairing the ROUND_START emitted at this
   round's top. Reached only at the natural end of a tools-executed
   iteration — an early ``continue`` for a premature-close retry does
   NOT reach here, so it never emits a spurious end for a round being
   re-run; every early ``break`` path emits its own reason-tagged
   ROUND_END upstream (budget / aborted / tool_timeout).

Both steps are control-flow-free — the helper mutates
``rs.last_checkpoint_ts`` in place and returns nothing.
