"""Per-round message hygiene: compaction + attachments + search-addendum cleanup.

Extracted 2026-07-31 (pt_03f4cdf1 slice 18) from
``lib/tasks_pkg/orchestrator/_run.py`` run_task stream loop.

Three message-hygiene steps run at the top of every round, AFTER the
ROUND_START / tool-round phase events and BEFORE the swarm-inbox
drain + LLM call:

1. **Two-layer context compaction** (``run_compaction_pipeline``):
   L1 micro-compacts cold tool results every round at zero LLM cost;
   L2 substitutes a smart summary as a synthetic tool result on
   context overflow.
2. **Per-turn attachments** (``compute_turn_attachments`` +
   ``inject_attachments``): dynamic context injection inspired by
   Claude Code's getAttachments() — session memory, file reminders,
   tool discovery deltas. Skipped on round 0 (system contexts were
   just injected). Wrapped defensively: attachment building is
   advisory and must never crash an otherwise-healthy task — any bug
   degrades to "no attachments this round".
3. **Legacy search-addendum cleanup**
   (``inject_search_addendum_to_user``): strips old "Current date and
   time:" prefixes from user messages (date now lives in the system
   prompt) so old conversations keep a proper cache prefix.

The helper mutates ``messages`` in place and returns nothing — every
step is internally guarded, so it is safe to call unconditionally.

        Working message list — mutated in place.

        Current round index (0-based). Attachments are skipped on

    project_enabled : bool
