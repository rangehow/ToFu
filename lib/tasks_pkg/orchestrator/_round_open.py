"""Per-round open — ROUND_START event + phase emit + accumulator build.

Extracted 2026-08-01 (pt_03f4cdf1 slice 32) from ``run_task``'s stream
loop. Two helpers at two different points of each iteration:

* ``emit_round_open`` runs at the TOP of the iteration (right after the
  abort gate): RENDER_CONTRACT Phase 3's explicit ROUND boundary plus
  the per-round phase event.
* ``build_stream_accumulator`` runs later (after round-request prep):
  the StreamingToolAccumulator construction.

The accumulator's project path deliberately comes from
``cfg.get('projectPath')`` — NOT the resolved ``project_path`` local —
byte-exact preservation of the inline original.
