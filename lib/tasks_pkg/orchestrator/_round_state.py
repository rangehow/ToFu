"""_RoundState — the ONE flat carrier for run_task's cross-iteration locals.

pt_862771477a86 slice 1 (owner-scoped, rulings 2026-07-27): a PURE CONTAINER
SWAP — the 14 locals of the stream main loop that cross the iteration
boundary live here instead of as bare function locals, so the loop body can
later be extracted into chassis hooks without re-discovering what crosses.

Shape rulings (owner, recorded in docs/ROUND_STATE_LOCALS_INVENTORY.md §5):
  * FLAT — no control/llm/usage/tools sub-objects (grouping lives in the
    comments below, not in the type, so access stays ``rs.exit_reason``
    rather than ``rs.control.exit_reason``).
  * ``round_num`` and ``_premature_retry_count`` are NOT here — the chassis
    (run_agent_loop) owns the round index and the retry bonus natively;
    they stay plain locals until the cutover. (Inventory counted 16
    cross-iteration locals; −2 chassis-owned = 14 fields.)
  * task-dict channels (``_peer_inject_pending`` etc.) are NOT here either —
    their owner is the task (crash-recovery / sync layer consume them
    directly); absorbing them would create a second source of truth.

Field defaults reproduce the historical inline initializers byte-for-byte
(:451-456 and :505-511 of the pre-slice _run.py).
