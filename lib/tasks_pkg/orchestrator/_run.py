            #   Background: when a model emits ``tool_calls=[{arguments: '...'}]``

            #   that mis-escape backslashes in regex args, e.g. ``\d`` instead
            #   of ``\\d``), parse_tool_calls() catches the JSONDecodeError and
            #   builds an error tool_result.  But the assistant message we
            #   already appended at line ~1361 still contains the RAW bad args.
            #
            #   On the next round, server_message_store / orchestrator replays
            #   ``assistant(tool_calls=[..bad args..]) + tool(error_msg)`` to
            #   the upstream gateway, which validates the JSON-string itself
            #   and rejects with HTTP 400 ``invalid function arguments json
            #   string``.  The whole conversation gets stuck — model never
            #   sees the error tool_result, can't recover, task ends in
            #   ``finishReason=error``.
