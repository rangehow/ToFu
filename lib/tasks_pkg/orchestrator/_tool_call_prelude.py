# HOT_PATH — called every stream round the assistant emits tool_calls.
"""Live-tail assistant/tool_call assembly + inter-round narration
discard + incremental auto-translate submit — the "we've decided to
call tools this round" bracket.

Extracted 2026-07-31 (pt_03f4cdf1 slice 16) from
``lib/tasks_pkg/orchestrator/_run.py``'s stream loop.

**What it does**
    Right after ``rs.tool_call_happened = True``, the stream loop
    performs three sequential mutations that all belong together
    — the ``we've decided to call tools this round`` bracket:

    1. Assemble the live-tail assistant/tool_call message through the
       SHARED ``build_assistant_tool_call_message`` (same as the
       replay path ``_reconstruct_tool_call_messages`` uses) — the
       SINGLE SOURCE guarantee that keeps live vs replay structurally
       identical (WIRE PREFIX CHANGED miss avoidance). Content is
       stripped, reasoning_content is carried whenever thinking is
       present, and the thinking-block signature only when present
       (so the NEXT tool-loop turn replays a signed thinking block).
    2. Discard the inter-round narration this round streamed before
       its tool calls (via ``_discard_pretool_prose``) so the
       backend and client agree on where prose ended, tool started.
    3. Submit an incremental auto-translate for this round's prose
       segment (via ``lib.translate.submit_round_segment``) so the
       Chinese lands by task end instead of one giant stall — gated
       + isolated inside the helper; a no-op when autoTranslate is
       off. Best-effort: a translate-side ImportError never breaks
       the LLM round.

**What it does NOT do**
    Does NOT run the tool execution pipeline (that lives inline in
    ``run_task`` — starts with the ``if task['aborted']`` early-exit
    check and continues into ``execute_tool_pipeline``). This helper
    is a pure mutation prelude — no early exits, no loop-mutation, no
    control-flow crossings.
