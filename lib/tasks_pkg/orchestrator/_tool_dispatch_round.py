"""Per-round tool dispatch: parse → sanitize → emit → heartbeat → execute.

Extracted 2026-07-31 (pt_03f4cdf1 slice 22) from
``lib/tasks_pkg/orchestrator/_run.py`` run_task stream loop.

Runs after the abort-before-tools gate and before the
consecutive-timeout circuit breaker. Four phases:

1. **Parse** (``parse_tool_calls``): parses all tool_calls from the
   assistant message, consuming round numbers from
   ``rs.tool_round_num``. ``early_announced`` passes the streaming
   accumulator's announced-tc map so tool_start events already sent
   during streaming are not re-emitted.
2. **Sanitize** (``sanitize_malformed_tool_call_args`` — slice 14):
   rewrites malformed JSON args in the stored messages so the next
   API round doesn't carry them back to the gateway (HTTP-400
   recovery).
3. **Emit** (``emit_tool_exec_phase``): execution-phase event so the
   frontend shows what is running.
4. **Execute** (``execute_tool_pipeline``): approval + parallel +
   result append. The reaper heartbeat
   (``task['_dispatch_heartbeat']``) is refreshed immediately before
   entering the pipeline — a long tool run (or a human-guidance /
   approval block inside it) emits no delta, so the positive-
   liveness clock must be refreshed or the stuck-task reaper could
   kill a healthy long tool. After the pipeline returns, the live
   ``_compact_messages`` ref is popped.

Returns the pipeline's ``_tool_timed_out`` flag so the caller can
feed the consecutive-timeout circuit breaker. Mutates ``messages``,
``rs.tool_round_num``, and the task sidecars in place.

        Project root path (pipeline input).
    project_enabled : bool
