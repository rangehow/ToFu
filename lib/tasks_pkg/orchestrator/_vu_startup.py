"""orchestrator/_vu_startup.py — VU startup + external-edit probe (run_task slice).

**Extraction context** (board epic ``pt_03f4cdf1``, slice 2, FIRST source
extraction from the 1813-line ``run_task``):

Two self-contained helpers that ``run_task`` previously carried as nested
closures inside its main ``try:`` block. Both were pure-ish (no dependency
on any local variable OTHER than what they explicitly closed over) so they
translate 1:1 to module-level functions taking their captures as arguments.

  * :func:`_vu_phase` — emit a PHASE event during the VU sub-task's
    startup window (silent no-op on ordinary worker/endpoint turns).
  * :func:`_probe_external_edits` — the daemon-thread target that runs
    the FUSE external-edit probe after ``ensure_project_state``; on
    detection of committed off-Tofu edits, appends a
    ``PROJECT_EXTERNAL_EDIT`` event so the UI can prompt the user.

Kept OUT of ``_finalize`` (post-loop helpers) and ``_turn`` (per-round
primitives) because they run ONCE at task startup and are neither
finalization nor per-turn.

**Strangler-fig discipline** (matches routes/chat_helpers.py's pattern):
these functions are DEFINED here; ``_run.py`` imports them and calls them
at the same source sites where the closures previously lived. There is now
exactly ONE definition of each. Wire-parity guarded by
``tests/test_lib_orchestrator_wire_parity.py``.

         conv as a live peer of the project root (feeds the
         "who is working here now" panel). A presence failure MUST NOT
