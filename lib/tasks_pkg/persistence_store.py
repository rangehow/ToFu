"""lib/tasks_pkg/persistence_store.py — Default ConversationStore adapter.

This is the **host side** of the agent base's persistence seam (see
``lib.protocols.ConversationStore`` and ``lib.agent_core.store``).  The
reusable agent base never imports ``lib.database`` / ``lib.conversations``
directly; instead it calls the store returned by
``lib.agent_core.store.get_conversation_store()``.  In a normal chatui
deployment that store is the :class:`DefaultConversationStore` defined here,
which is backed by the project's PostgreSQL/SQLite layer.

Because this adapter is the concrete, DB-bound implementation, it lives OUTSIDE
``lib/agent_core/`` (a CORE_MODULES location, which is forbidden from importing
``lib.database``) — exactly mirroring how ``lib.tasks_pkg.manager`` is the
DB-bound implementation behind the ``TaskEventSink`` protocol.

Methods are added here in lock-step with the core call sites migrated behind
the seam (see ``lib/agent_core_manifest.py`` boundary stages).
