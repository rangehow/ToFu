"""lib/tasks_pkg/segments.py — the ordered typed-segment model (SoT groundwork).

Board epic ``pt_cb8f98b0cb9b47fb`` (design: docs/EPIC_SEGMENT_TIMELINE_DESIGN.md).

An assistant turn is stored today as THREE parallel channels on the task dict:
``task['content']`` (deliverable string), ``task['thinking']`` (reasoning
string), and ``task['toolRounds']`` (ordered per-round dicts). They are not
interleaved, so the chronological order the model produced
"thinking → prose → tool → prose → answer" is lost — which is the root cause of
both the headless "narrator" leak (streaming compat forwards every delta, incl.
scaffolding prose) and the grouped-by-type UI layout.

This module introduces the replacement: ONE ordered, append-only list of typed
segments (the Anthropic content-blocks shape we already half-emit). Each text
segment carries a ``deliverable`` flag — the structural boundary between the
answer and inter-round narration that the three-channel model lacks.

**Step 1 discipline (this file): SHIPS DARK.** ``assemble_segments`` is
populated alongside the three channels; the three channels are proved to be
loss-less *projections* of the segment list via ``derive_content`` /
``derive_thinking`` / ``derive_tool_rounds``. NOTHING reads the segments yet
(the compat surfaces, DB persistence, and the frontend are migrated in later
steps). The golden test ``tests/test_segment_model.py`` pins byte-identity so
none of the ~40 measured backend readers can drift.

Ordering observer (the "single seam" question): the interleaving is ALREADY
fully captured at finalization time — no token-level hook is needed. Each
llmRound batch's pre-tool prose is stamped onto the FIRST entry of that batch
as ``assistantContent`` / ``thinking`` / ``thinkingSignature``
(``lib/tasks_pkg/tool_dispatch.py`` ~725) *before* ``_discard_pretool_prose``
zeroes the accumulators; the terminal round's deliverable prose survives in
``task['content']`` / ``task['thinking']``. So the ordered
``_merge_tool_rounds(task)`` list + the terminal strings are a complete,
lossless record. This module is a pure function of that record.

``deliverable`` rule (explicit, position-based, INDEPENDENT of
``_discard_pretool_prose`` having run): a ``text`` segment is
``deliverable=False`` iff it is the ``assistantContent`` of a tool-round batch
(prose emitted in a round that went on to call tools); it is
``deliverable=True`` iff it is the terminal ``task['content']`` (prose from the
round that ended the loop with no tool calls). Because assembly reads the
pre-tool snapshot (``assistantContent``) and the terminal string separately,
the classification would still be correct even if the discard reset were
deleted — the NC-1 in the golden test pins exactly that.

Pure functions; no Flask, no DB, no LLM. No logger side effects in the hot
projections (they run at finalization, once per turn).
