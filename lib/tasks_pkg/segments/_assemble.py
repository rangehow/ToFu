"""lib/tasks_pkg/segments/_assemble.py — build the ordered typed-segment list.

``assemble_segments`` is populated alongside the three legacy channels
(``content`` / ``thinking`` / ``toolRounds``); those channels are proved to be
loss-less *projections* of the segment list via the ``_derive`` module.

Ordering observer: the interleaving is ALREADY fully captured at finalization
time. Each llmRound batch's pre-tool prose is stamped onto the FIRST entry of
that batch as ``assistantContent`` / ``thinking`` / ``thinkingSignature``
before ``_discard_pretool_prose`` zeroes the accumulators; the terminal round's
deliverable prose survives in ``task['content']`` / ``task['thinking']``. So
the ordered merged list + terminal strings are a complete, lossless record.

``deliverable`` rule (explicit, position-based): a ``text`` segment is
``deliverable=False`` iff it is the ``assistantContent`` of a tool-round batch;
``deliverable=True`` iff it is the terminal ``task['content']``.

Pure functions; no Flask, no DB, no LLM.
