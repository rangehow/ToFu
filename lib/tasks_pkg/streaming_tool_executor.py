"""Streaming Tool Executor — start executing read-only tools while the model streams.

Inspired by Claude Code's ``StreamingToolExecutor`` (``tools/StreamingToolExecutor.ts``).
When the model emits multiple tool calls in one response, read-only tools
(``read_files``, ``grep_search``, ``find_files``, ``list_dir``, ``web_search``,
``fetch_url``, ``check_error_logs``) begin executing as soon as their arguments
finish streaming, rather than waiting for the complete response.

Write tools and approval-gated tools are NOT pre-executed — they are deferred
to the normal serial dispatch in ``tool_dispatch.py``.

Architecture
------------
1. The orchestrator creates a ``StreamingToolAccumulator`` before each LLM call.
2. The ``on_tool_call_ready`` callback is passed through
   ``stream_llm_response`` → ``dispatch_stream`` → ``stream_chat`` →
   ``_stream_chat_once``.
3. Each time a tool call's arguments finish during SSE streaming, the callback
   fires immediately.
4. **NEW**: The callback also immediately emits ``tool_start`` SSE events so
   the frontend can show "Searching…" / "Running…" UI without waiting for the
   entire LLM response to finish streaming.
5. If the tool is read-only and concurrency-safe, it is submitted to a thread
   pool for immediate execution — **while the model is still generating the
   next tool call**.
6. After the stream completes, the orchestrator calls ``inject_into_cache()``
   to harvest results.  Already-done results are collected immediately;
   still-running futures are **waited on** (not cancelled), since they are
   already in-progress and would be executed serially otherwise — waiting
   is strictly faster than cancelling + re-executing from scratch.
7. The results are stored in the task's ``_tool_result_cache`` dict, keyed
   exactly like ``tool_dispatch._make_cache_key``.  When
   ``execute_tool_pipeline`` runs, it finds pre-computed results in the
   dedup cache and skips re-execution.
