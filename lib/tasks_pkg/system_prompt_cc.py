"""Claude Code-style system prompt sections (ported verbatim where possible).

This module ports the static system-prompt sections from Claude Code
(``src/constants/prompts.ts``: ``getSimpleIntroSection``, ``getSimpleSystemSection``,
``getSimpleDoingTasksSection``, ``getActionsSection``, ``getUsingYourToolsSection``,
``getSimpleToneAndStyleSection``, ``getOutputEfficiencySection``,
``getSystemRemindersSection``, ``computeSimpleEnvInfo``) into Tofu.

Design: one function per section, each returning either a string or None.
Nothing in this file reads runtime state — sections that depend on env info
accept explicit arguments. This mirrors Claude Code's static-section layout
where everything below `__SYSTEM_PROMPT_DYNAMIC_BOUNDARY__` is intentionally
cache-stable.

The ``is_code_context`` flag (== project_enabled at the caller) gates the
SWE-bench-shaped content (code-hygiene bullets in ``# Doing tasks``, the
git/CI examples in ``# Executing actions with care``, and the SWE framing
in the intro). When False, the prompt becomes a generic-assistant prompt:
the model isn't biased toward "I'm doing code now" framing for translation,
paper Q&A, daily-report or trading turns.

Tool-name substitutions vs Claude Code:
  Claude Code tool → Tofu tool
  ────────────────────────────────
  Read / FileRead         → read_files
  Edit / FileEdit         → apply_diff / insert_content
