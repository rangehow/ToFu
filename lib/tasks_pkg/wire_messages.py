"""Single source of truth for the "what the model actually receives" message view.

The debug panel exists to diagnose context drift, so it MUST show the exact
OpenAI-form message array the LLM sees — not an earlier intermediate state.
Historically two paths fed the panel and disagreed:

  * COLD — ``GET /api/v1/conversations/<id>/debug-messages`` ran only
    ``build_api_messages_from_db`` (no system-context injection, no
    cache-reorder, no sanitization).
  * HOT — the live ``messages_snapshot`` SSE was captured in the orchestrator
    AFTER ``_inject_system_contexts`` but BEFORE ``sort_tool_results`` and
    BEFORE ``build_body``'s sanitization.

Neither equalled the real outbound (wire) array. This module collapses both
onto one function so the panel is faithful.

Two public entry points
=======================
``apply_wire_sanitize(messages, *, conv_id='', provider_id='')``
    The model-agnostic, IO-free tail of ``build_body`` — the transforms that
    change the *OpenAI-form messages array* the model receives:
        sort_tool_results → _strip_non_api_fields → (gated) _sanitize_messages
        → _fix_orphaned_tool_calls → _merge_consecutive_same_role
        → _fix_empty_user_messages
    DELIBERATELY OMITS the transport-layer / provider-body steps
    (_validate_image_blocks disk I/O, _downscale_oversized_images Pillow,
    vision-strip, gemini/claude reasoning injection, provider-specific body
    fields) — those reshape the transport envelope, not the logical message
    list, and are surfaced to the user as "transport-layer transforms not
    expanded" rather than shown.

``build_wire_messages(raw_messages, config, *, mode, task=None, conv_id='', provider_id='')``
    The full COLD-path pipeline:
        _transform_messages → _inject_system_contexts → apply_wire_sanitize
    ``mode='snapshot'`` (the endpoint) runs inject with a throwaway task and
    empty conv_id so it is side-effect-free and never pollutes the live
    request path's conv-keyed caches; per-round content (memory
    ``<relevant_memories>`` / date) is reconstructed as a hypothetical
    first-round, which the panel labels as an approximation.

Gateway-sanitization parity
===========================
``_sanitize_messages`` (the gateway-blocked-term replacement) is PROVIDER
GATED inside ``build_body`` at lib/llm/body.py:511 exactly as::

    _pid == 'sankuai' or (not _pid and 'sankuai' in lib.LLM_BASE_URL)

The chat main loop builds its body with ``provider_id=''`` (orchestrator.py
:1533) and the pre-built-body dispatch branch never re-runs sanitization, so
the real outbound array's gateway step is decided by that auto-detect on
``LLM_BASE_URL``. We REPLICATE that gate verbatim here so the wire preview is
never MORE aggressive than the real request (an unconditional sanitize would
over-clean and lie in the other direction).

    Operates on a deep-ish copy (``_strip_non_api_fields`` already returns
    shallow per-message copies; ``sort_tool_results`` mutates the passed list
    so we copy first) — never mutates the caller's list. This is the ONE
    implementation shared by the live snapshot and the ``/debug-messages``

      1. ``sort_tool_results`` — cache-aware reorder of consecutive tool
         results by ``tool_call_id`` (orchestrator.py:1531).

      3. ``_sanitize_messages`` — gateway-blocked-term replacement, GATED on
         ``_gateway_sanitize_enabled`` (verbatim build_body:511 gate).
      4. ``_fix_orphaned_tool_calls`` — Anthropic orphan tool_use/result repair.
      5. ``_merge_consecutive_same_role`` — consecutive user/assistant merge.
      6. ``_fix_empty_user_messages`` — empty-content placeholder.
