# ── Project Charter tools (Pillar #2 of the project brain) ──
# The Charter is the shared "north star" of a project — read by every
# conversation, so they coordinate around one intent. An agent may READ it,
# PROPOSE amendments, and (2026-07-12, owner-directed) self-COMMIT a DECISION
# (append implementation-level consensus) so shared intent advances without a
# human in the loop. The agent path can ONLY append a decision — it can never
# edit the north-star `content` (goal/direction stays human-owned), and a human
# retains the corrective levers (edit/remove a decision, delete the charter).
# Project-scoped, registered only in project mode (registry._build_conv_ref).

# auto-land machinery. The project now uses a single shared checkout: agent
# edits write straight to the served tree and take effect on the next restart —
# no lease, no commit, no land step. A minor same-file overlap between siblings
# is hand-fixable interference, never a block. The board/charter/feed/peer
# blackboard (advisory, never blocking) remains the coordination surface.
