# against the integration branch. project_sync is the recovery companion to
# project_commit's land: it pulls the latest integration HEAD INTO the conv's
# worktree (a MERGE that leaves standard conflict markers), so the conflict is
# resolvable in-place with normal edit tools and the next land fast-forwards.
# Without it a conflicted conversation would re-land → held → re-land forever.
