"""lib/tools/image_gen.py — Image generation tool definition and constants.

Provides the ``generate_image`` tool that the LLM can call mid-conversation
to create images.  The tool is gated by the ``imageGenEnabled`` toggle in
the frontend — when enabled, the tool appears in the LLM's tool list and
the executor calls ``lib.image_gen.generate_image()`` to produce the image.

``IMAGE_GEN_TOOL_NAMES`` is used by tool-display, executor, and the
frontend's ``_isRoundImageGen()`` for UI rendering.
