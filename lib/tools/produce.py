"""lib/tools/produce.py — High-level "one sentence → finished video" tool.

The chat surface of the production substrate (docs/PRODUCTION_PIPELINE_DESIGN.md
拍板 #5): a SINGLE semantically-clear tool so the model naturally selects it
when the user says "make me a science-explainer video about <topic>", instead
of orchestrating the 8 low-level ``motion_video_*`` tools by hand.

Unlike the low-level family, ``produce_video`` is NOT project-gated (拍板 #2):
"say one sentence and get a film" cannot require the user to first attach a
project, so a topic job with no project renders under the server's data dir.
It kicks off a background job (research → script → timeline → render →
assemble) and returns immediately with a ``task_id`` the UI polls — the model
does not block on the multi-minute render.
