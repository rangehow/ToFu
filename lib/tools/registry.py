"""lib/tools/registry.py — Declarative tool-assembly registry.

This module is the **single seam** through which both built-in and
third-party tools declare *what schema the LLM sees* and *when that tool
is active*.  It exists to collapse the hand-maintained ``if feature: …``
ladder that used to live in ``lib.tasks_pkg.model_config._assemble_tool_list``
into a list of self-describing :class:`ToolSpec` objects.

Why this matters
----------------
Before this module, adding a native tool meant editing a core
orchestration file (``model_config.py``) — a hardcoded if-branch per
feature.  Now a tool author registers a :class:`ToolSpec` (schema + gate)
once, in their own file, and the orchestrator picks it up with **zero**
core edits.  Third-party packages can contribute tools via the
``tofu.tools`` entry-point group (see :func:`discover_plugin_specs`).

Design contract (DO NOT BREAK)
------------------------------
1. **Ordering is prompt-cache-critical.**  Specs are emitted in
   registration order within their phase.  The built-in registration
   order reproduces the A/B-validated layout exactly:
   search → fetch → read_files → project|code_exec → browser → desktop →
   image_gen → conv_ref → human_guidance → ⟨base/capability boundary⟩ →
   memory → scheduler → swarm → mcp.
2. **Two phases.**  ``phase='base'`` specs are emitted first and counted
   toward ``has_base_tools`` (the value the orchestrator calls
   ``has_real_tools``).  ``phase='capability'`` specs are emitted after,
   and may read :attr:`ToolContext.has_base_tools` to self-gate.
3. **Lazy imports.**  A spec's ``build(ctx)`` is called at request time, so
   heavy schema imports (browser, swarm, mcp, …) stay out of startup.
4. **Side-effect gates are allowed.**  ``build()`` may log (e.g.
   "browser requested but extension not connected") and may return an
   empty list — exactly mirroring the legacy behaviour.

Plugin isolation (multi-tenant)
-------------------------------
``discover_plugin_specs()`` loads third-party ``tofu.tools`` entry points into
the SAME process-global ``_TOOL_SPECS`` list as the built-ins.  On a shared,
multi-tenant server (e.g. the headless ``/api/v1/agent/run`` API) that means a
plugin installed for one caller would otherwise be visible to EVERY caller —
its tool schema (and any imperative "always call me first" text in that schema)
silently pollutes unrelated requests.

To prevent this, every spec carries a :attr:`ToolSpec.source`
(``'builtin'`` | ``'plugin'``) tag and plugins additionally carry a
:attr:`ToolSpec.plugin_name`.  :func:`assemble_tool_list` consults the
per-request :attr:`ToolContext.enabled_plugins` allow-list:

* built-in specs are ALWAYS evaluated;
* a plugin spec is evaluated only when its ``plugin_name`` is allow-listed.

The allow-list is resolved per request by :func:`resolve_enabled_plugins` from
``cfg['plugins']`` (request-scoped) falling back to the
``TOFU_DEFAULT_TOOL_PLUGINS`` env var (deployment-wide default).  The default
when neither is set is **fail-closed**: NO third-party plugins are visible.  A
dedicated single-tenant deployment that wants the old "everything I installed
is on" behaviour sets ``TOFU_DEFAULT_TOOL_PLUGINS=*`` (or passes
``cfg['plugins']='*'``), which maps to ``enabled_plugins=None`` (gate fully
open).  This isolation is a VISIBILITY boundary (the LLM never sees the schema),
not a security sandbox — a plugin's handler code still lives in-process.

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class ToolSpec:
    """A declarative tool contribution.

    Parameters
    ----------
    key:
        Unique feature key (e.g. ``'search'``, ``'project'``, ``'memory'``).
        Used for de-dup, introspection, and log lines — NOT shown to the LLM.
    build:
        ``Callable[[ToolContext], list[dict]]`` returning the OpenAI-style
        function schemas to add (possibly empty).  Called at request time,
        so do lazy imports here.  May log and may inspect
        :attr:`ToolContext.current_count` / :attr:`~ToolContext.has_base_tools`.
    phase:
        ``'base'`` (counted toward ``has_real_tools``, emitted first) or
        ``'capability'`` (emitted after the base/capability boundary).
    provides:
        Tool names this spec can contribute.  Used for introspection and to
        derive write/idempotent partitioning downstream.  Optional — purely
        informational; the schemas returned by ``build`` are authoritative.
    write_tools / idempotent_tools:
        Subsets of :attr:`provides` that mutate state / are safe to cache.
        Consumed by ``tool_dispatch`` to keep its concurrency + dedup
        partitions in sync without a second hand-maintained list.
    category / description:
        Human-readable metadata for tooling and docs.
    handler:
        Optional :data:`ToolHandlerFn` that executes this tool's calls.  When
        set, it is auto-synced into the dispatch ``tool_registry`` for every
        name in :attr:`provides` (or :attr:`handler_names` if given).  This is
        what lets an EXTERNAL plugin ship schema + gate + executor from a
        single ``tofu.tools`` entry point — no separate handler-registration
        step in core.  Built-in tools leave this ``None`` and keep registering
        handlers via ``@tool_registry`` decorators in
        ``lib/tasks_pkg/handlers/`` (unchanged).
    handler_names:
        Override the set of tool names :attr:`handler` is bound to.  Defaults
        to :attr:`provides`.  Use this when the handler serves names not listed
        in ``provides`` (rare).
    handler_special:
        If set (e.g. ``'__code_exec__'``), register :attr:`handler` as a
        *special* dispatch key instead of by exact name.
    source:
        Provenance of this spec — ``'builtin'`` (registered by core at import
        time) or ``'plugin'`` (contributed by a third-party ``tofu.tools``
        entry point).  Set automatically by :func:`discover_plugin_specs`;
        built-ins keep the default.  Drives the per-request visibility gate in
        :func:`assemble_tool_list`: ``'builtin'`` specs are ALWAYS evaluated,
        ``'plugin'`` specs only when allow-listed via
        :attr:`ToolContext.enabled_plugins`.  This is the multi-tenant
        isolation seam — see the module-level "Plugin isolation" note.
    plugin_name:
        For ``source='plugin'`` specs, the entry-point name the spec was loaded
        from (e.g. ``'liantong_kb'``).  This — NOT :attr:`key` — is what a
        caller lists in ``config.plugins`` / ``TOFU_DEFAULT_TOOL_PLUGINS`` to
        make the plugin visible.  One entry point may register several specs;
        they all share its ``plugin_name``.  Empty for built-ins.
