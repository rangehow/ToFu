            "if needed.** Don't fetch every result; the summaries usually decide which "

            "- Trending AI papers (e.g. 'hf daily papers', 'trending papers this week', "

            "FORCE a domain-level vertical search regardless of phrasing.\n"
            "- ``academic`` — works with FREE-TEXT topics. The dispatcher adapts to the "

            "search + Semantic Scholar related work (run in parallel).\n"

            "(tries PyPI + npm + GitHub for that exact name; 'best react libraries' "
            "returns nothing — use a plain web search for discovery).\n"
            "- ``finance`` — needs a ticker symbol (e.g. AAPL).\n"
