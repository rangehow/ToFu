"""lib/translate/segment_backfill.py — narration-segment translation backfill.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES
-------------------
Auto-translate stamps per-round Chinese onto ``msg.segments[*].translatedText``
(read by the settled segment-timeline renderer) via two paths:

  • the LIVE incremental worker (``lib.translate.incremental``) — stamps each
    narration segment as its round closes, for forward-looking streaming turns;
  • the retro / whole-message path (``lib.translate.runtime._do_translate``) —
    builds ``{llmRound: 中文}`` and stamps too, but ONLY when it RUNS.

The retro path breaks early for a turn that already carries a non-stale
``translatedContent`` (its DELIVERABLE was translated), so a turn translated
before segments were stamped keeps its Chinese only in the bottom
``translatedContent`` blob — the interleaved narration falls back to English and
NEVER recovers on its own (no client/server path re-requests it, because both
``needsTranslation`` and the retro guard treat the turn as "done").

``_migrate_backfill_segment_translations`` fixes EXISTING rows once. This module
is the FORWARD fix: it is invoked on the conversation-GET path so that opening a
conversation with auto-translate on backfills any such ``_translateDone`` turn's
narration in the background (fire-and-forget), the exact "when I open a
conversation" behaviour.

SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
----------------------
Reuses the EXACT translate core the live retro path uses
(``lib.translate.runtime._translate_segments_to_map`` — same eligibility,
notranslate handling, already-Chinese skip, enrich-only) and the EXACT stamp
helper (``lib.translate.commit._stamp_segment_translations``). It does NOT
re-implement "which segment is translatable" or "how the field is stamped". The
one-shot migration imports ``needs_segment_narration_translation`` from HERE so
the predicate is defined once.

REV-CAS NEUTRALITY
------------------
Stamping changes the ``messages`` column, which fires
``conversations_rev_bump_trg`` (rev → rev+1) and would make every open client
eat a spurious CAS 409. The write is guarded on the rev we read (skip on a
concurrent writer) and then resets rev back to that value in the SAME
transaction; ``updated_at`` is left untouched (no sidebar re-sort). Idempotent:
a re-run finds every narration already stamped → the core returns ``{}`` → no
write.

Thinking segments are intentionally never translated (backend contract — the
translator only stamps non-deliverable ``text`` narration segments).
