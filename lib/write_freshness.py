"""Per-conversation write-freshness tokens (shared-HEAD overwrite guard).

On a shared working tree, conversation A can read a file at T0, think for
many rounds, and at T2 blindly overwrite a change sibling B committed at T1.
The read-before-edit gate (``lib/tasks_pkg/handlers/_read_gate.py``) proves
"you read this file at SOME point in this conversation"; it cannot prove
"the file has not changed SINCE". This module closes that gap with an
optimistic-concurrency token:

  • Every successful read / write / edit records a fingerprint
    ``(mtime_ns, size)`` of the target under ``(conv_key, abs_path)``.
  • Write tools are CHECKED before execution (see
    ``lib/tasks_pkg/handlers/_write_freshness_gate.py``): a recorded
    fingerprint that no longer matches the on-disk one means someone else
    touched the file → the write is refused with a re-read instruction
    instead of silently clobbering the sibling's change.

Deliberate failure directions:

  • A MISSING token never blocks (``is_stale`` → False). Blind full-rewrite
    flows that never read the file keep working — the read-before-edit gate
    owns the "must read first" axis for the edit tools; this module owns
    ONLY the "your knowledge went stale" axis.
  • A VANISHED file drops the token and allows the write (creation
    semantics); the read gate surfaces the cleaner "File not found" path
    for the edit tools.

Fingerprint — why content, not mtime (MEASURED, do not "simplify" back):

  This deployment's filesystem (dolphinfs, FUSE) has **1-SECOND mtime
  granularity**: ``st_mtime_ns % 1_000_000_000 == 0`` for every file,
  ctime is equally coarse, and inode does not change on rewrite. A
  ``(mtime_ns, size)`` fingerprint is therefore BLIND to the edit class
  "same 1-second tick, same byte count, different content" — exactly what a
  fast sibling edit (or an atomic tmp+os.replace inside the same tick)
  produces. Verified live: 10 same-size writes within one second changed
  the fingerprint ZERO times.

  So for files ≤ ``_CONTENT_HASH_MAX_BYTES`` the fingerprint is
  CONTENT-addressed: ``('c', size, blake2b-128)``. Same-second same-size
  edits with different content are caught; a content-preserving touch is
  NOT stale (nothing to clobber). Files ABOVE the threshold keep the
  ``('m', mtime_ns, size)`` fast path — they are data/asset payloads, not
  the source-edit scenario, and the residual same-second blind spot there
  is documented rather than paid for with a full read on a FUSE mount.

  The threshold's job is to exclude multi-MB DATA/BINARY payloads
  (models, datasets, archives) — NOT source text. It is 4 MiB because the
  project's most sibling-contested tracked file, ``static/styles.css``,
  measured 1,026,466 bytes (owner-verified 2026-07-25) and sat ABOVE an
  earlier 256 KiB value — on the blind fast path, exactly where the CSS
  extraction/dead-style-sweep batches collide. blake2b at GB/s hashes
  4 MiB in single-digit milliseconds. Coverage is drift-guarded:
  tests/test_write_freshness_gate.py::test_tracked_text_files_stay_under_hash_threshold
  flips red the day any tracked text file outgrows it.

Restart persistence (pt_1bbd3cc82eb44ddc): the store is in-memory, so
any restart used to wipe every token and leave the gate fail-open until
each conversation's next read — the auto-restart watcher made that window
recur on every HEAD move. ``save_snapshot()`` (called before the re-exec
in ``routes/api_v1/update.py::_perform_server_reexec`` and via an atexit
hook for the signal path — atexit does NOT run on execv, hence both) and
``load_snapshot()`` (called once from server.py boot) carry the small LRU
across a restart via ``data/write_freshness_tokens.json``.

Replay semantics, deliberate: a replayed token preserves EXISTENCE ("this
conversation demonstrably read/wrote this file") — it does NOT vouch for
freshness across the downtime. The first ``is_stale`` after replay
re-fingerprints the file and compares against the replayed content hash,
so a file changed while the server was down is still judged stale
(refuse → re-read). That is the safe direction; the cost is one extra
read per file per conversation after a restart.

Env: ``TOFU_WRITE_FRESHNESS_GATE=0`` disables recording AND checks AND
persistence.
This module is a leaf: stdlib + lib.log only, so both ``lib/project_mod``
(write-side recording) and ``lib/tasks_pkg`` (the gate) can import it
without cycles (runtime_paths / json_store are imported lazily inside the
snapshot functions).
