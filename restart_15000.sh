# ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
# │ RUN THIS FROM A TERMINAL THAT IS **NOT** A CHILD OF THE :15000 SERVER.    │
# │ A plain VS Code terminal is fine. Do NOT run it from inside a Tofu agent  │
# │ shell — that shell is a child of the :15000 process, so killing the       │
# │ server would also kill the shell running this script (self-plug-pull).    │
# └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
#
# WHY THIS SCRIPT WAS REWRITTEN (2026-07-10):
#   The live server is launched as `python server.py` with NO `--port` argument
#   (the port defaults to $PORT / 15000 inside server.py). The previous version
#   matched `pkill -f "server.py --port 15000"`, which matched NOTHING, so the
#   old process was never killed; the relaunch then either shifted to :15001 via
#   server.py's _find_free_port fallback OR aborted on the instance lock
#   ("Another server instance is already running"). Root fix: kill the EXACT PID
#   that is actually listening on :15000 (from `ss -ltnp`), escalate SIGTERM →
#   SIGKILL if the port doesn't free, and only then relaunch — with the SAME
#   command the process really uses (`python server.py`, no --port).
#
# Safe to re-run (idempotent): if nothing is on :15000 it just launches one.
# No `set -e` on the whole script so "nothing to kill" is not fatal.
#
# DETACH (2026-07-16): the relaunch uses `setsid nohup` so the server starts in
# its own session with NO controlling terminal — a code-server terminal/session
# reap can no longer SIGTERM it. Output still goes to ${LOG} (the shell does the
# redirect, not nohup). Step [4b/5] asserts the live listener really left this
# terminal (tty=?, no "+" in STAT, sid≠this shell). For a server that must also
# survive OOM/crash, prefer the supervisord program instead — see
# deploy/supervisor/tofu.conf (autostart/autorestart=true).
#
# MUTEX (2026-07-16): this script and the supervisord program are TWO owners of
# :15000 and must never both drive it. Step [pre/5] detects when supervisord
# already manages tofu and REFUSES to kill/relaunch (pointing you at
# `supervisorctl restart tofu`), so the two mechanisms can never fight. Once the
# supervisord program is installed, use supervisorctl — not this script.
#
# SERIALIZE (2026-07-16): step [pre/5b] takes an flock on data/.restart.lock so
# concurrent sibling restarts on a shared-HEAD box queue instead of both killing
# the listener at once (the paired-SIGTERM signature). After acquiring the lock
# it skips a redundant restart iff a sibling ALREADY brought up a healthy
# instance that STARTED AFTER this restart began (start-time proof, not just
# "port is occupied"), so a stale pre-existing process is still reloaded.

# ── [pre/5] MUTEX GUARD — refuse to run if supervisord already OWNS tofu. ──
# The durable fix (deploy/supervisor/tofu.conf) hands :PORT to the host
# supervisord with autorestart=true. If BOTH mechanisms are live they FIGHT:
# this script's [1/5] kill → supervisord instantly relaunches (grabbing the
# port) → this script's [3/5] relaunch then aborts on the single-instance lock
# (or races a second instance). So once supervisord owns tofu, the ONLY correct
# restart entrypoint is `supervisorctl restart tofu`; this script must stand
# down. Detection is layered so a partial install can't slip through:
#   (1) the program is defined AND not STOPPED/absent (RUNNING/STARTING/BACKOFF
#       — i.e. supervisord is actively managing/relaunching it), via whichever
#       supervisorctl invocation works (plain, or sudo -n if the socket is
#       root-only). A definitive RUNNING/STARTING/BACKOFF is authoritative.
#   (2) fallback when supervisorctl is unreachable (no sudo, socket perms): the
#       conf is installed under /etc/supervisor/conf.d AND a :PORT listener's
#       process tree traces back to the supervisord daemon (ppid chain hits a
#       `supervisord`) — that proves supervisord, not a terminal, spawned it.
# A clean STOPPED/absent program, or conf present but the listener is NOT a
# supervisord child, means the script may proceed (manual mode).

# ── [pre/5b] RESTART SERIALIZATION LOCK — one restart at a time on this box. ──
# On a shared-HEAD box, multiple sibling agents may each run this script to load
# a commit, unaware of each other. Without a lock they BOTH reach [1/5] and kill
# the same listener at the same second (the observed paired SIGTERMs), then race
# two relaunches — one aborts on the single-instance lock. This flock serializes
# restarts: the 2nd caller BLOCKS on fd 9 until the 1st fully finishes (the lock
# is held for the whole kill→relaunch→verify span because fd 9 stays open until
# this script exits). Placed AFTER the [pre/5] supervisord guard and BEFORE the
# [1/5] kill, so the kill phase itself is always inside the lock.
#
# SECOND-PROBE (skip-if-already-done): after we finally GET the lock, a sibling
# that held it first may have JUST relaunched a healthy new instance loading the
# same HEAD — killing it and relaunching again is pure waste. So we skip ONLY
# when BOTH hold: (i) the health endpoint answers, AND (ii) the live listener
# was STARTED AFTER this restart began (a fresh instance a sibling spawned while
# we waited), proven by process start-time — NOT merely "something is on the

# ── [4b/5] DETACH SELF-CHECK — prove the live listener really left the terminal.

#   launcher/re-exec parent) and assert, via `ps`:

# ── [5/5] Self-verify the EVENT-LOOP-FREEZE FIX (commit c194e18) is actually
#          loaded in THIS running server — NOT some unrelated older feature.
#          Two independent, fix-specific probes, BOTH must pass:
#            (a) STATIC: the fix's new symbols import cleanly under the SAME
#                interpreter that launched the server. If HEAD predates the fix
#                these names don't exist → ImportError. This proves the code is
#                on disk + importable for the launch interpreter.
#            (b) RUNTIME: the new _serve guard code actually executed during
#                THIS boot — the running process emitted a "Loop blocking-guard"
#                line to ${LOG}. NOTE: that guard is DEFAULT OFF (set_debug is
#                unsafe as a 24/7 default on this high-concurrency service), so
#                the normal boot prints "Loop blocking-guard OFF (default)"; a
#                diagnostic boot (TOFU_LOOP_DEBUG_GUARD=1) prints "... armed".
#                EITHER line proves the NEW _serve code ran (both are new in
#                this fix); a boot on OLD code prints neither. A static import
#                can't prove the running process executed the new path — the
#                live log line does. The always-on LoopWatch 5s net is what
#                actually protects production; this guard is the opt-in
#                sub-stall detector.
#          Why probe THIS and not sticky-cwd: the previous [5/5] verified
#          get_conv_cwd/set_conv_cwd (a DIFFERENT commit). A green there says
#          nothing about whether the freeze fix shipped — the probe must assert
#          the change this restart is FOR.

#     STREAM FIX (2026-08-03): the proof line is emitted at INFO level, and

#     0 INFO lines vs 990 WARNING+ lines) — grepping ${LOG} can never match
