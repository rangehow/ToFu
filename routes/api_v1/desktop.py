"""routes/api_v1/desktop.py — Desktop-agent status probe + pairing surface.

The status/build/download/streams/devices routes are REST verbs the Local
Control panel consumes. The pairing routes (pair-code mint + pair
exchange) implement the one-time pairing-code UX
(docs/DESKTOP_AGENT_DIST_DESIGN.md §11): the panel mints a 6-digit code
(authenticated), the agent exchanges it for an agents:bridge token (the
code IS the credential — no bearer).

The actual long-poll RPC channel (``POST /api/desktop/poll``) stays at
its original path under :mod:`routes.desktop` because it's a Bridge-Secret-
authenticated long-poll between server and agent, not a JSON REST verb.

    The setup surface must present a single next action, never a menu of
    every possible path — so the CHOICE is made here, where the facts
    actually live, rather than guessed in JS.

    * ``connected``  — an agent polled within the window; nothing to install.
    * ``tray``       — this server process is the packaged desktop app
      (``sys.frozen``, set by PyInstaller and re-exec'd by
      desktop/launcher.py with TOFU_RUN_SERVER=1). The agent runs
      IN-PROCESS via the tray's "Enable Computer Control" item, so the
      instruction is one click and no token is involved.
    * ``remote``     — anything else: the user's machine is not this
      machine, so they need the desktop app plus a bridge token.

    ``sys.frozen`` is the load-bearing signal, NOT the peer address:
    :func:`routes.api_v1.auth._remote_is_loopback` documents that a
    same-host reverse proxy makes every public request present as
    loopback, so it can never distinguish "the user is on this box" from
    "the user is behind nginx". A frozen process, by contrast, IS the
    tray app by construction. Loopback is consulted only to keep a
    source-run local dev server (frozen=False, peer=loopback) out of the
    ``remote`` bucket — it would otherwise be told to install a second
    copy of an app it is already running.

    ── The tunnel blind spot (measured 2026-08-02, owner live) ──
    An ssh -L port forward makes a REMOTE machine's browser present as
    loopback too, and the server has NO signal to tell it apart from a
    true local dev server — so ``local_source`` is structurally wrong
    for tunnel users: its primary instruction ("install the full desktop
    app") installed a second Tofu on the office machine whose bundled
    server grabbed a fallback port and whose agent polled IT, never this
    one. The honest fix is NOT re-classification (impossible without a
    distinguishing signal — a guess would misroute true-local users) but
    the surface escape hatch: the local_source branch renders a
    collapsed "从另一台电脑访问本服务器？" details section with the
    agent download + mint flow (local-control.js). Anyone tempted to
    "detect the tunnel" here: there is nothing to detect.

    ── Zero network in the request path ──
    This used to resolve against ``api.github.com`` SYNCHRONOUSLY (TTL-cached,
    up to a 6 s timeout) inside an async route: every cache expiry stalled the
    event loop, which is the measured reason the Local Control modal's desktop
    row "always takes much longer". The answer now comes from the LOCAL
    artifact store (lib/desktop_dist): the background mirror keeps the
    published installers on this server's disk, so the client's download
    itself no longer depends on its route to the public GitHub network either.

    When the store cannot serve this platform yet (first boot, refresh in
    flight), the row is omitted and the mirror is kicked — the releases-page
    escape hatch stays, and the modal's 3 s poll pops the direct link in once
    the file lands. URLs are ABSOLUTE, built from the request's own host — an
    address the user demonstrably reaches (see _agent_server_url). Under a
    path-prefixed cloud-IDE proxy (…/proxy/<port>/) the host alone is NOT
    enough — the proxy strips the prefix before forwarding, so the backend
    structurally cannot see it, and the click dies on the gateway's default
    route without ever reaching Tofu. The client therefore re-bases the
    canonical ``/api/...`` tail onto its live ``BASE_PATH`` before rendering
    (local-control.js ``_lcResolveDlUrl`` — the same seam as pdf_viewer.js
    ``_resolvePaperPdfUrl``).

    ``arch_override`` is the architecture the CLIENT resolved for itself via
    ``navigator.userAgentData.getHighEntropyValues(['architecture'])`` — the
