"""routes/api_v1/research.py — durable read path for auto-research artifacts.

WHY THIS BLUEPRINT EXISTS (epic pt_a40dbd9569194b52, second half)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Persisting the research artifacts gave them a durable home; this gives them a
door. Without it the artifacts sat in ``paper_reports`` with no way for the
product to ask for them, which is the same orphan shape the persistence layer
itself was fixing.

**Why this is not served by ``GET /api/v1/tasks/<id>``.** That endpoint resolves
against the in-memory ``TaskRuntime`` registry, so it 404s the moment
``cleanup_stale()`` sweeps the finished task (TTL 7200s) or the process
restarts — exactly the window durable storage exists to cover. It is also
addressed by TASK id, while a persisted research row is addressed by
DIRECTION: the same direction re-researched later is the same row. So this is a
structurally different lookup, not a duplicate of the generic task surface, and
the two are complementary:

    live job, progress + abort   → /api/v1/tasks/<id>
    finished work, any time later → /api/v1/research/lookup?direction=…

``found: false`` is a normal 200 answer, not a 404: the re-attach path calls
this on every open, and "this direction has not been researched" is information,
not an error.
