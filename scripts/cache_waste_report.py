"""Cache-waste distribution report — the reproducible form of a one-off audit.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
The 2026-07-29 cache-cost investigation produced its distribution table from
three throwaway shell one-liners. The conclusion was right, but the *process*
was not reproducible, and it was wrong twice on the way there:

  1. the denominator initially covered only part of the rotated logs;
  2. the price constants were hand-derived by dividing two audited totals, and
     came out 27x off;
  3. the percentile printer used ``if p50 else '-'``, so a legitimate
     ``gap_s == 0`` rendered as "missing" — which is precisely what hid 218
     cold-start rounds inside the ``no_break`` bucket until someone noticed the
     arithmetic did not add up.

All three are structural traps, not typos, so this script nails them down:

  * **Rates come from ``lib.cost.compute_cost``** — the same engine the product
    bills with. Never hand-write a CNY-per-token constant here; if the rate is
    wrong, it is wrong in exactly one place and the product is wrong with it.
  * **Non-waste classes are excluded from the recoverable denominator and
    reported separately.** A TTL expiry rebuilt an entry that expired on its
    own schedule; a cold start had no predecessor to read back. Neither is
    money we could have saved, and folding them in inflates the number people
    then go chasing.
  * **Percentiles treat 0 as a number.** ``gap_s == 0.0`` is a real, meaningful
    measurement (same-instant round-1), not a missing value.

USAGE
    python3 scripts/cache_waste_report.py                  # all rotated logs
    python3 scripts/cache_waste_report.py --glob 'logs/app.log'
    python3 scripts/cache_waste_report.py --min-write 20000 --json

The input is the ``[CacheRoundRecord]`` JSON line emitted once per LLM round by
lib/tasks_pkg/cache_tracking/_detect.py, which stamps its bucket via the
single-source ``classify_verdict``. Offline and live counts therefore cannot
drift.

TWO LIMITATIONS YOU MUST READ BEFORE QUOTING A NUMBER
=====================================================
1. **Buckets are stamped at write time, not re-derived here.** That is what
   keeps offline and live counts identical, but it means records written
   BEFORE a classifier change still carry the old bucket. Rounds logged before
   the 2026-07-29 ``ttl_expiry`` fix (commit b402b696) are still stamped
   ``body_change`` / ``other``; the ``ttl_expiry`` row only fills in as newer
   traffic accumulates. Do NOT patch that up by re-deriving the rule here — a
   second copy of the bucketing logic is exactly the drift this report exists
   to prevent. If you need history restated, replay the records through
   ``classify_verdict`` itself.
2. **The records carry no model id, so ``--model`` prices every row.** A mixed
   fleet is therefore approximated at one model's rate. Token counts and round
   counts are exact; CNY is only as right as ``--model``. Opus-5 vs Opus-4.5
   differ 3x, so passing the wrong one silently triples the answer.
