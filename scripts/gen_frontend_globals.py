"""Generate ``static/js/globals.generated.d.ts`` from the real frontend source.

Why generated and not hand-written
----------------------------------
Tofu's frontend is a concatenated bundle with ONE shared global scope
(``lib/js_bundler.py`` joins files with no wrapper), so a module's public
surface is whatever it happens to leave on ``window`` — an implicit contract
that ``tsc --checkJs`` cannot see. The tempting fix is to hand-write
``declare var X: any;`` for each complaint, but that DOWNGRADES THE CONTRACT TO
A COMMENT: the declaration and the code drift the moment a symbol is renamed,
and nothing detects it. Worse, a hand-written ``declare`` silences a genuinely
MISSING symbol just as effectively as it declares a real one, so the tool stops
catching the exact bug class it was installed for.

This generator instead DERIVES the declarations from the source of truth:
  * ``window.X = ...`` / ``global.X = ...`` / ``globalThis.X = ...`` assignments
    (the deliberate export gesture).

Rename a symbol and the generated file changes with it; DELETE a symbol and its
declaration disappears, so every reader of it goes red. That is the property a
hand-written ambient file cannot have.

What is deliberately NOT declared (measured, not assumed)
--------------------------------------------------------
Top-level ``function``/``var``/``const`` declarations in BARE (non-IIFE) files
are already visible to ``tsc`` — a script-scope ``.js`` in the program
contributes its top-level names to the global scope on its own. Declaring them
AGAIN in an ambient ``.d.ts`` does not help; it CONFLICTS. Measured: declaring
all 2451 discovered symbols took the error count from 92 to 452, adding 174
TS2403 (subsequent declarations must have the same type), 162 TS2300 (duplicate
identifier) and 23 TS2451 (redeclare block-scoped variable).

So the rule is: declare a symbol ONLY when ``tsc`` cannot already resolve it —
i.e. it is exported via ``window.X =`` from inside an IIFE (private to that
function scope, public at runtime), or injected from outside ``static/js``
entirely. That keeps this file to the genuine interface surface instead of
restating what the compiler already knows.

Usage
-----
    python3 scripts/gen_frontend_globals.py            # write the file
    python3 scripts/gen_frontend_globals.py --check    # verify it is up to date

``--check`` is what CI runs (tests/test_frontend_globals_generated.py): it
regenerates in memory and fails if the committed file differs, so the
declarations can never silently drift from the code.
