    ``unlink`` the lock path. Unlinking yields a brand-new inode on the retry;

    # ── Patch Request async methods/properties for sync route handlers ──
    # In Quart, get_json(), form, files, data, and json are async. Sync
    # route handlers (run in executor threads via run_sync) get coroutine
    # objects instead of values. Monkey-patch the Request class to run
    # the coroutine on the MAIN event loop — NOT a fresh child loop.
    #
    # The naive ``asyncio.run(coro)`` here is wrong: it spins up a new
    # loop in the worker thread, and the coroutine then awaits hypercorn's
    # request body Future, which lives on the main loop. Cross-loop
    # awaits never wake up — symptom: large POST bodies hang server-side
    # until the client times out, while small bodies (already inlined
    # into the ASGI scope before dispatch) work fine. Fix: schedule via
    # ``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` on the loop saved by
    # ``hub.set_loop`` at startup.

# The four file handlers + the stderr StreamHandler all do SYNCHRONOUS I/O
# under a per-handler lock. error.log lives on a FUSE/NFS mount (see
# _tofu_logs_root), so a WARNING/ERROR *storm* (e.g. a total upstream 502
# outage emitting thousands of lines) would serialize every logging thread
# behind slow network writes — INCLUDING the sync threads serving GET / and
# the health/conversation endpoints. That converts ANY log storm into a dead
# frontend ("backend alive, frontend can't be served"), independent of what
# caused the storm.
#
# Fix (structural, not a time-bound): the root logger gets a SINGLE
# QueueHandler whose emit() is just a non-blocking queue.put() — it never
# touches the disk or the handler locks. A dedicated background thread
# (QueueListener) drains the queue and performs the actual file/stderr I/O.
# So a request/serving thread that logs during a storm returns immediately;
# only the listener thread ever blocks on the slow mount. The queue is
# unbounded (put_nowait never blocks/drops), so no log line is lost — a burst
# just grows the in-memory queue and the listener catches up.

# native-async send_static_file runs is_file()/stat()/full-file-read directly on
# the event loop — one stall on the FUSE-backed static/ dir wedges the whole
# server. This replacement moves ALL blocking filesystem I/O into a worker
# thread under a hard timeout, so a FUSE stall degrades one request to a fast
# 503 while the loop keeps serving everyone else.
#
# Invariants (see the three sign-off requirements):
#   1. Path traversal: _load_static_bytes uses werkzeug.safe_join (the same
#      primitive the built-in route used) — never a hand-rolled os.path.join —
#      so '..'/absolute/escape resolves to None → 404, never a file leak.
#   2. 404 vs 503 stay DISTINCT: a genuinely-missing file returns 404 (so the
#      stale-bundle self-heal in _handle_404 / resolve_stale_bundle keeps
#      working); only an executor TIMEOUT (the FUSE-wedge signal) returns 503.
#   3. Caching preserved: we compute size+mtime+adler32 ETag in the thread and
#      build a conditional response on the loop (make_conditional → 304), and
#      add_cache_headers still stamps the immutable/max-age headers afterward.

    SIGTERM/SIGINT are the deliberate stop signals. SIGHUP is included on
    purpose: when the server is (wrongly) launched attached to a terminal —
    e.g. ``python server.py`` in a code-server terminal — closing that
    terminal makes the kernel deliver SIGHUP to the foreground process group,
    whose default disposition is *terminate*. That single hangup would take
    the server down along with the terminal session. Routing SIGHUP through
    the same graceful-drain handler makes "close the terminal" a clean,
    connection-draining shutdown instead of an abrupt death — defence in depth
    for the case the supervisor launch path is bypassed. Only signals that
    actually exist on this platform are returned (Windows has no SIGHUP).

        A list of signal numbers to register the graceful handler on.

        # ── Event-loop stall watchdog ──
        # We have no supervisor and faulthandler only fires on C-level fatal
        # signals, so a wedged event loop (a blocking call on the loop thread,
        # a starved executor, a FUSE/PG stall) currently goes SILENT: the port
        # stops accept()ing while the process stays alive, and we get no stack
        # to diagnose it. This turns that into a captured all-thread dump.
        #
        # TWO complementary capture paths:
        #
        #  (A) GUARANTEED, GIL-INDEPENDENT — faulthandler.dump_traceback_later.
        #      The async heartbeat acts as a watchdog PET: on each bump it
        #      cancels + re-arms a C-timer set to fire in _stall_threshold s.
        #      While the loop is healthy the timer is petted before it fires;
        #      when the loop wedges — even inside a single monolithic
        #      GIL-holding C call (the documented json.dumps / catastrophic-
        #      regex pit) — the timer's DEDICATED C THREAD fires WITHOUT taking
        #      the GIL and writes an all-thread dump to the FUSE-resilient
        #      /dev/shm sink. This is the path that covers the one root cause
        #      the project has proven can happen.
        #
        #  (B) COMPLEMENTARY, human-readable — an off-loop daemon thread watches
        #      the heartbeat timestamp and, on a stall, emits an ERROR log line
        #      (with measured duration) + a dump to the FUSE log sink. It works
        #      for GIL-RELEASING stalls (blocking syscalls: FUSE/PG) but is
        #      BLIND to a GIL-held wedge (it must take the GIL to run) — hence
        #      it is a signal, never the sole guarantee. Path (A) is.
        #
