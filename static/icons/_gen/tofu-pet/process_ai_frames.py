"""process_ai_frames.py — turn the AI-generated raw poses into shipped frames.

PIPELINE (raw 1024² chroma-green PNG → shipped transparent PNG)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The raw poses live beside this script at ai/raw_<pose>.png (generated with the
image tool, one img2img edit per pose off ai/hero_v1.png — see JOURNAL
2026-07-30). Each raw file is a cream tofu cube on a near-pure green backdrop.

★ ONE GLOBAL SCALE, ONE SHARED ANCHOR (2026-07-31 rewrite — read this before
  touching any step). The previous pipeline trimmed EACH frame to its OWN alpha
  bbox and scaled it so ITS OWN longest side hit MAX_SIDE. That makes the scale
  factor a FUNCTION OF THE POSE, which broke the character in three separate
  ways, all measured on the shipped frames:

    · SIZE WOBBLE. Scale spanned 0.1837–0.2319 (26%). A rigid facial feature
      (blush cheek-to-cheek span) therefore varied 34.5% across the 22 frames
      and 9.7% within walk1..4 alone — i.e. the character breathed a tenth of
      its own width 13 times a second while walking. Read as "glitching".
    · LATERAL TELEPORT. Re-centring on the INK bbox means asymmetric FX (the
      thinking bubble, alert/celebrating sparkles) shove the BODY sideways: the
      body centre sat −2.20..+0.06 px off sprite centre, an 8%-of-width jump
      fired by a mere MOOD change, with nothing actually moving.
    · FX PAY FOR THEMSELVES IN BODY SIZE. A pose whose FX enlarged the ink box
      got scaled DOWN to fit, shrinking the body to make room for its sparkles.

  The raw masters are NOT at fault and must not be redrawn: body width across
  walk1..4 varies only 1.2% in the raws vs 6.4% shipped. The defect was 100%
  downstream, so the fix is here.

  Both fixes are one idea: measure the CHARACTER, not the ink. For every frame
  we locate the BODY (the largest opaque connected component — the tofu cube,
  which excludes detached FX) and derive two anchors from it: the body's centre
  X and the ink's foot line Y. Then ONE scale, computed once from the extremes
  across ALL frames, maps every raw into an IDENTICAL canvas with those anchors
  at fixed coordinates. Size constancy and registration are then STRUCTURAL —
  properties of the layout, not a coincidence that holds until someone adds a
  pose with bigger sparkles.

For every ENGINE frame name in FRAME_SOURCES we:

  1. CHROMA-KEY the green out. Distance in "greenness" space
     (g - max(r, b)) with a soft ramp, so the dark outline keeps its edge
     instead of being eaten, then DESPILL (clamp g to max(r, b)) so the cream
     body doesn't carry a green fringe.
  2. MEASURE the anchors: body centre X (largest opaque component, so FX are
     excluded) and foot line Y (bottom of ALL ink — the feet are the lowest
     thing drawn, and a cast shadow would key out with the backdrop).
  3. COMPOSITE onto the SHARED canvas at ONE global scale, with body centre on
     the canvas midline and the foot line on the canvas bottom. No per-frame
     trim, no per-frame normalisation. The canvas is symmetric about the body
     centre so the CSS facing mirror (scaleX) pivots on the body, not on
     wherever this pose's FX happened to land.
  4. DERIVED frames: walk5..8 replay walk1..4 (the stride's second half-cycle
     is the same four drawings), groom1/3 are ±6° rotations of groom2 (the
     wobble the pose ticker plays).

Because every frame now shares one canvas, `object-fit:contain` in the CSS is a
NO-OP scale (all frames identical size) rather than a per-frame renormalisation
— which is precisely why the wobble is gone rather than merely reduced.
