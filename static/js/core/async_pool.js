/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   core/async_pool.js — bounded-concurrency task runner.

   ONE small primitive shared by every "sweep over N conversations on
   wake/reconnect" path. Without a cap, a tab that slept overnight with
   500+ conversations fires all N fetch/SSE-reattach calls at the same
   instant when it wakes (`visibilitychange` / `online` / boot-reconnect).
   That reconnect "thundering herd" saturates the event loop and — over a
   constrained proxy — the network, which is the front-end half of the
   observed overnight slow-recovery (the back-end half was the inline
   bundle rebuild, fixed in bf7c9b9).

   runWithConcurrency(items, worker, limit) runs `worker(item, index)` over
   `items` with at most `limit` in flight at once, draining as each settles.
   A rejected worker never aborts the pool (mirrors the existing
   Promise.all(...map) call-sites which already swallow per-item errors);
   errors are collected and returned so a caller can inspect them.

   Leaf module — references only `window` at load; called at runtime by
   core/cross_tab_sync.js and core/health_stream_timer.js. Bundled by
   lib/js_bundler.py (_BUNDLE_FILES) BEFORE those consumers.
