   core/brand_logo.js — THE single source of the brand mascot URL

   CACHE-BUST is the whole job. Every reference to the welcome mascot used to
   be a bare `static/icons/tofu-welcome.svg`, and the server serves icons with
   `cache-control: public, max-age=86400`. So any change to the file was
   invisible for up to 24h — a logo rollback looked like it "didn't happen",
   and the owner spent a day looking at art that had already been reverted.
   Role icons already solved this with a `?v=` token (orchestration-catalog.js
   `_ORCH_ICON_VER`); the main logo did not. `LOGO_VER` below is that token.
   Bump it whenever the art changes.

   ── ONE MASCOT, NO SWITCHING (owner decision, 2026-07-29) ──────────────
   This module briefly carried a skin registry so candidate mascots could be
   worn at runtime and judged in place. That mechanism is GONE, by explicit
   instruction: "I only want the original version … the others are too ugly
   and there is really no need to switch." It is the THIRD veto of mascot
   switching (the +40% redraw and the A2 soft-edge were each approved from a
   contact sheet and then reversed once live; the project-bar pet's in-bar
   switcher was cut for the same reason).

   So: do NOT reintroduce a skin list, a Settings picker, or a localStorage
   preference here. Judging brand art still requires seeing it in place — but
   the way to do that is to swap the shipped asset behind a bumped LOGO_VER
   on a branch, not to ship a wardrobe to users. tests/test_brand_mascot_single.py
   holds this as a ratchet: the module must resolve exactly one URL.

   Every render site MUST go through brandLogoImgAttrs() (or, for the two
   static tags in index.html, carry the same `?v=` token) — a hand-written
   bare path silently loses the cache-bust, which is the one failure this
   module exists to prevent.

   This file is concatenated by lib/js_bundler.py; symbols share the global
   window scope. No exports.
