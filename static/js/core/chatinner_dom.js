   core/chatinner_dom.js — the ONE ordered-insert primitive for #chatInner

   WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE (the whole point — do not fold it back in)
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   #chatInner holds two kinds of children:

     * MESSAGES   — `.message` nodes, a projection of conv.messages, ordered.
     * FURNITURE  — `#_lazyLoadSentinel` (head) and `#_lazyLoadSentinelBottom`
                    (tail): the lazy-window strips that stand in for messages
                    evicted above / below the rendered span.

   Furniture is NOT a message, but it lives in the same child list, so every
   positional DOM call has to step over it. That obligation was implicit, and
   it was violated at BOTH ends — the same bug twice:

     HEAD (2026-07-26, f1691021): the surgical reconcile in chat_render.js
       anchored its first insert on `inner.firstChild`, which is the HEAD
       sentinel when a lazy window is open. Every background repaint slid the
       sentinel down one slot until it reached the bottom; then
       `_loadOlderMessages` (`sentinel.after(frag)`) spliced the OLDEST
       messages below the newest one.

     TAIL (this file): `_ensureBottomSentinel` pins itself with
       `inner.appendChild(s)`, so it is the LAST child. `ConvView.apply` and
       `ConvView.startStreaming` used `insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend', …)`,
       which lands AFTER it:
           seed:                      a, b, SENT_BOT
           after apply(NEW):          a, b, SENT_BOT, NEW
           after startStreaming():    a, b, SENT_BOT, NEW, LIVE
       Then `_loadNewerMessages` (`sentinel.before(frag)`) splices the
       recovered tail ABOVE the message you just sent — the head inversion
       again, at the other end.

   The head fix did not prevent the tail bug because its anchor was a CLOSURE
   inside renderChat's surgical block: ConvView could not reach it, so the
   rule could not be shared. That is the actual lesson, and this module is the
   answer — ONE place that knows where furniture lives, reachable by every
   writer.

   THE RULE: no file other than this one may write to #chatInner with a raw
   positional API (`firstChild` as an anchor, `insertAdjacentHTML('beforeend')`,
   `appendChild`, `prepend`). Enforced by
   tests/test_frontend_lazy_sentinel_anchor.py.

   Leaf module: touches only `document` / `console`. Must load BEFORE every
   consumer (chat_render.js, conv_view.js) — order pinned by the same test.

/* ── Runtime order invariant (RENDER_CONTRACT Invariant 1) ─────────────────
 *
 * Both ordering bugs survived for months because NOTHING ever asserted the
 * thing the contract actually promises: the rendered DOM is a projection of
 * conv.messages, in order. Scenario tests only catch the scenario someone
 * thought of; this catches the shape.
 *
 * Two properties, checked together because they fail together:
 *   1. the message children's `data-msg-id` sequence is a SUBSEQUENCE of
 *      conv.messages (a lazy window renders a subset — that is legal; being
 *      out of order is not);
 *   2. no furniture sits BETWEEN two messages that are adjacent in the array
 *      (furniture stands in for ELIDED messages, so a strip between two
 *      neighbours is a misplaced sentinel — exactly the head bug, caught
 *      before it can migrate far enough to invert anything).
 *
 * ── PRODUCTION VISIBILITY: deliberate decision, not a flag default ────────
 * This check is NOT debug-gated. It was, and that made it inert on every real
 * deployment (`debug_mode` resolves to False by default in lib/__init__.py),
 * so the only people it could ever inform were developers who already knew.
 * BOTH ordering bugs reached real users and produced no signal — which is the
 * exact failure mode this exists to end.
 *
 * Cost is bounded and small: one pass over `inner.children`, and the rendered
 * span is capped by `_MAX_RENDER_WINDOW` (80). Inserts are per-turn events,
 * not per-token. A violation LATCHES, so a broken page reports ONCE — the
 * same discipline as core/identity_gate_tripwire.js, because a condition that
 * recurs on every repaint would otherwise bury its own signal.
 *
 * Delivery rides the EXISTING production beacon (`Api.clientError.report` →
 * POST /api/client-error → server log), the same channel the global
 * window.onerror handler already uses. No new endpoint, no new node.
 *
 * NEVER throws and NEVER mutates: reporting a broken projection must not also
 * break the render. */
