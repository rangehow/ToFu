   core/current_user.js — resolve THIS tab's tenant identity at boot
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   pt_679d064f68ac4dd6 (owner picked option B — fetch users/me on boot).

   WHY THIS EXISTS
   ---------------
   Four client-side multi-user gates read `window._currentUserId`:

     * core/conv_state_reducer.js::_frameIsOurs
     * core/cross_tab_sync.js::_onConvNotifyPush
     * core/cross_tab_sync.js::_onFoldersChangedPush
     * conv_sync_push.js::_onConvSyncPush

   Before this module NOTHING ever wrote that global, so every gate was
   structurally inert (`myUser === null` → accept-all). Correct for a
   personal install, but it means a multi-tenant deployment has no identity
   to compare a frame against. c6d1bd71 landed the SERVER half (the WS
   handshake resolves AuthContext.user_id and every notify frame is stamped);
   this module is the client half that makes the gates live.

   THE CONTRACT
   ------------
   `GET /api/v1/users/me` is PUBLIC (routes/api_v1/users.py:266) and already
   returns the three shapes we care about:

     multi-tenant login  → {authenticated:true,  user:{id, email, …}}
     personal install    → {authenticated:true,  user:null, principal:{…}}
     unauthenticated     → {authenticated:false, user:null}

   Only the first yields an identity. The other two resolve to `''` — every
   gate treats empty as "no identity established" and accepts all frames,
   which is the pre-commit behaviour preserved EXACTLY. A personal install
   therefore sees zero change.

   FAIL-OPEN, NOT FAIL-CLOSED
   --------------------------
   A boot-time network hiccup resolves to `''` (accept-all) rather than
   leaving the global undefined or throwing. Rejecting every frame because
   /users/me was briefly unreachable would brick the sidebar — strictly
   worse than briefly accepting a frame in a deployment that has no second
   tenant anyway.

   TYPE NOTE (do not "simplify" this)
   ----------------------------------
   The id is written VERBATIM — a numeric tenant id stays a number. The
   server's `_request_user_id()` / `task_user_id()` int-coerce numeric ids
   (`int(uid) if str(uid).isdigit() else uid`), so a frame can legitimately
   carry `userId: 7` while a different code path carries `'7'`. Every gate
   String()-normalizes BOTH sides for exactly that reason. Coercing here
   too would be a second, redundant normalization that could drift from the
   gates' rule.

   ORDERING
   --------
   main.js boot awaits this BEFORE wiring the push subscribers, so the very
   first frame is already evaluated against a resolved identity.
