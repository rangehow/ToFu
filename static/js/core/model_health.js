   core/model_health.js — THE model-availability judgment (SSOT)

   WHY THIS EXISTS
   ---------------
   A logical model on a gateway is served by a POOL: every (wire id × API
   key) pair is an independent slot, and the dispatcher rotates over the
   whole pool. `claude-opus-4.7` carries 3 request_ids and the provider has
   3 keys → 9 slots. `deepseek-v3.2` carries 4 ids → 12 slots.

   Therefore the ONLY correct availability rule is:

       ██ A logical model is USABLE iff ANY slot in its pool is usable. ██

   The rule this replaces summed `total_requests` / `total_errors` across
   the pool and divided. With 8 dead slots and 1 healthy one that yields
   ~11% → a red "warn" card for a model the dispatcher serves perfectly
   well. A gateway that redeploys ONE upstream (the yuju daily builds) made
   every affected card permanently red, which is exactly how a health signal
   loses the user's trust. A pooled AVERAGE answers "how lossy is the pool",
   which is a cost/latency question; it does NOT answer "can I select this
   model with confidence", which is what the card is for.

   TWO INPUTS, ONE RULE
   --------------------
   Both axes feed the same judgment so the two can never disagree:

     * RUNTIME  (/api/v1/dispatch/model-health rows, per wire id) —
       a slot is usable when `available_slots > 0`. Passive: reflects
       traffic that already happened.
     * PROBE    (probe-cells snapshot cells, per key × wire id) —
       a cell is usable when `status === 'ok'`. Active: answers
       "is it usable RIGHT NOW" even with zero traffic.

   LEVELS
   ------
     ok            — every observed slot usable
     degraded      — SOME slots usable (dispatcher still serves; the pool
                     is thinner than it looks). Never render this as a
                     failure — it is a working model.
     down          — NO slot usable. The only level that means "don't pick".
     unknown       — no observation at all (never probed / never routed)
     skipped       — non-chat modality with no probe surface implemented
     not_logged_in — subscription (OAuth) provider with no live token; the
                     pool cannot be judged, and this is NOT a model fault

   STALENESS is orthogonal to the level: a green verdict from three days ago
   must not read as "good now". `stale` is computed from the snapshot's
   `finished_at` and callers render it as its own muted state — the whole
   point of the feature is telling "tested, healthy" apart from "not tested".

   Pure module: no DOM, no network, no window state read at load. Consumed
   by settings/key_stats.js (runtime strip) and the preset-tab probe dots.
   Concatenated by lib/js_bundler.py — window scope, no imports.
