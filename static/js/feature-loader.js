   feature-loader.js — on-demand loader for the DEFERRED feature bundle.

   The app ships as TWO bundles (see lib/js_bundler.py):
     • the CORE boot bundle (bundle-<hash>.js) — everything needed for
       first paint + chat, loaded eagerly as today;
     • the FEATURE bundle (feature-<hash>.js) — heavy, rarely-first-used
       modules (paper reader, orchestration studio, task mode) that most
       sessions never open. It is NOT loaded at boot; it is fetched the
       first time the user actually opens one of those features.

   Both bundles run in the SAME global (window) scope — they are plain
   concatenated <script>s, NOT ES modules — so once the feature bundle
   loads, its real functions (togglePaperMode / openOrchestration /
   openTaskMode …) OVERWRITE the tiny stubs installed here, and every
   later call hits the real implementation directly with zero overhead.

   The feature bundle's hashed URL is injected into the page by
   routes/common.py as `window.__FEATURE_BUNDLE_SRC__`. When bundling is
   disabled / failed (dev fallback → individual <script> tags), that
   global is absent and the real functions are already present, so the
   stubs are never installed (see _installFeatureStub guard).

   This file is CORE (in _BUNDLE_FILES) — it must load before main.js.
