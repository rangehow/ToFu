/* ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   local-control — the SINGLE "let Tofu act on my machine" surface.

   Merges what used to be two toolbar rows (#browserToggle + #desktopToggle),
   one setup modal (#browserModal) and one blind flag flip (toggleDesktop with
   no status check at all). From the user's side browser-tabs and
   computer-control are one concept; two rows, two modals and two status dots
   were strictly more cognitive load than one.

   What did NOT merge, deliberately: the two backing flags `browserEnabled`
   and `desktopEnabled` stay separate on the wire. They gate different tool
   families with genuinely different risk tiers (reading a tab vs running a
   shell command), and `lib/tools/registry/_build.py` builds them from two
   independent ToolContext fields. Only the SURFACE is merged.

   ── The one rule this file exists to enforce ──
   Each capability row shows exactly ONE next action, chosen by DETECTED
   state. Never a menu of every possible path, and never an instruction the
   user cannot act on from where they are. The desktop choice is made by the
   BACKEND (`setup_state` on /api/v1/desktop/status) because only the server
   process can see `sys.frozen` — the frontend must not re-derive it.

   ── …and the FLOOR that rule stands on ──
   "Chosen by detected state" used to mean "rendered only after detection":
   the modal opened showing `local.checking` ("正在检查…") over an EMPTY setup
   box, and the install instructions appeared one or two network round-trips
   later. Every user paid a wait to be told the thing that is true for almost
   all of them — and the failure modes were worse than the wait: if the status
   call errored the box was blanked back to empty, and if `Api` was not yet
   defined `_lcRefresh` returned without painting anything at all, leaving
   "正在检查…" and an empty box on screen permanently.

   So detection now UPGRADES an instruction that is already on screen rather
   than being the thing that puts one there. `_lcPaintFloor` runs
   synchronously on open with the guidance that holds regardless of what the
   probe finds (download the extension / install the desktop app), and the
   renderers replace it with something MORE specific once the payload lands.
   The floor is never "loading" and never empty, so the worst case is an
   instruction that is merely generic — never one that is absent.

   Corollary, and the reason the download markup lives in `_lcBrowserDownload`
   rather than inline: the floor and the detected `download` state are the
   SAME instruction, so they must be ONE authoring. Two copies of it would
   drift, and a drifted floor is a wrong instruction shown first.

   This file is concatenated by lib/js_bundler.py — symbols share the same
   window scope as every other static/js/*.js file. No imports/exports.
