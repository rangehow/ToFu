   settings/section_requires.js — the degraded-section contract

   THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR (2026-07-29, found by the owner in the live UI):
   the "Brand mascot" block's heading + description are static HTML spliced in
   server-side, while its tiles are painted by JS from core/brand_logo.js. When
   that module isn't in the served bundle (a running server holds the bundle
   manifest it booted with, so a NEW module only appears after a restart), the
   user saw a title, a description, and an EMPTY BOX — a control that looks
   available and does nothing. Project rule: a feature that cannot work must
   not present itself as usable.

   THE CONTRACT (generic — not a one-off patch for the logo picker):
   any settings block whose behaviour depends on a JS symbol declares it:

       <div class="settings-section-needs-js" data-requires="listLogoSkins">
         …heading / description / control…
         <div class="settings-section-js-missing">此功能需重启服务后生效。</div>
       </div>

   `data-requires` takes one or more space-separated global symbol names. At
   settings-open we check them: all present → the block renders normally and
   the notice stays hidden; any missing → the CONTROLS are hidden and the
   notice is shown, so the failure is visible and self-explanatory instead of
   silent. Adding a new JS-dependent section is one attribute, no new code.

   This file is concatenated by lib/js_bundler.py; symbols share the global
   window scope. No exports.
