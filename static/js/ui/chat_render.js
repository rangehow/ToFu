 * close-out summary (below) as the visible spine — "human msg → report".
 *
 * Grouping keys on the EXPLICIT `data-ap-run` id stamped by renderMessage
 * (VU turns + summary) — never role-scanning. The interleaved worker
 * assistant turns between VU turns are NOT individually stamped, so we fold
 * the contiguous DOM sibling RANGE from the run's first stamped element up to
 * (but excluding) its `data-ap-summary` element. A run is "concluded" iff its
 * summary element is present in the DOM; an in-progress run (no summary yet)
 * stays fully expanded and live.
 *
 * Idempotent + surgical-safe: re-running over already-folded DOM is a no-op
 * (the inner turns live inside `.autopilot-run-fold` and are skipped). The
 * <details> open/closed state is preserved across re-renders via a per-run
 * memory so a forced re-render doesn't snap an expanded run shut.

 * (3 render call-sites + the run-concluded sidecar plumbing still invoke it)
 * but now does the OPPOSITE of folding: it defensively UNWRAPS any stale

 * an undelivered VU reply there would read back as words the human actually
 * said), so without this notice the transcript simply STOPS: the last thing on
 * screen is the agent asking a question, with no indication that the loop ended
 * or that work was done and withheld. That silence is the whole bug — the run
 * died and the UI showed nothing at all for 2h12m.
 *
 * So the terminal fact is rendered from the SIDECAR record instead: why the run

/* ── TWO liveness questions, TWO predicates (pt_ae8777b4eee04ef1) ──────────
 *
 * renderMessage used to answer "has this turn settled?" FOUR separate times,
 * and they disagreed:
 *     _isLiveTail     = activeStreams.has || conv.activeTaskId     (read the pin)
 *     isLastAssistant = !activeStreams.has                         (did NOT)
 *     canDelete       = !activeStreams.has && !conv.activeTaskId   (read the pin)
 *     _turnFailed     = error || finishReason === 'interrupted'    (no liveness)
 * With the SSE down but the conv still pinned to a running task — a cold attach
 * to an autopilot VU carrier, a socket-down window, the poll-only lane — the
 * first said IN FLIGHT (and correctly suppressed the finish bar) while the
 * second said SETTLED, IN THE SAME RENDER PASS. The action bar and the Continue
 * button then rendered under a turn the backend was still generating.
 *
 * The second half of that defect is the settlement verdict: the backend
 * deliberately WITHHOLDS finishReason mid-stream, and computeTurnSettlement
 * maps a MISSING reason to `interrupted` / resume:'checkpoint' (fail-open,
 * which is right for a legacy or historical turn). So "no finishReason yet"
 * reads as "interrupted and resumable" — correct ONLY once you know the turn
 * has actually stopped. Liveness is that missing dimension; it can never be
 * inferred from the absence of finishReason.
 *
 * ★ WHY TWO PREDICATES AND NOT ONE. The first fix collapsed all four onto
 * `computeConvBusy`, the composer/sidebar union. That imported a semantic the
 * render gate must NOT have: computeConvBusy ALSO scans for branch-stream keys
 * (`conv.id + ':'` — branch_stream.js writes `convId:msgIdx:branchIdx` into
 * activeStreams). "Is anything running in this conversation" is the right
 * question for the sidebar dot and the Stop button; it is the WRONG question
 * for "is this turn's tail still being written". Measured consequence: with a
 * branch streaming, a MAIN turn that had already finished (finishReason=stop,
 * usage present) lost its finish bar and its Delete button — the mirror of the
 * bug being fixed. A branch stream does not write the main tail, so:
 *
 *   TURN level  (_isTurnInFlight)   — writers of THIS turn's tail only:
 *       this tab's MAIN stream (exact `conv.id` key), the optimistic
 *       `conv.activeTaskId` pin, and the server-authoritative
 *       `_authoritativeActiveTaskIds` (which INCLUDES VU carriers behind the
 *       `#vu` marker — the only way the poll lane sees a live autopilot turn).
 *       Deliberately NO branch-key prefix scan.
 *       Consumers: the finish bar, the Continue affordance, the force-reveal.
 *
 *   CONV level  (_convBusyAnyLane)  — delegates to computeConvBusy, so it is
 *       byte-identical to what the Stop button reads, branch scan included.
 *       Consumer: Delete. Deleting a message while ANY lane of this
 *       conversation streams can pull the anchor out from under a live branch
 *       (branch_stream.js keys its stream on convId:msgIdx:branchIdx, so a
 *       shifting index corrupts it), and the action-gate fingerprint token —
 *       the sidebar-facing "is this conv busy" fact.
 *
 * Load order is pinned: core/conv_state_reducer.js is bundled before
 * ui/chat_render.js (lib/js_bundler.py _BUNDLE_FILES). The inline fallback in
