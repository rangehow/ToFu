"""Post-restart acceptance check for the runaway-agent guards (2026-07-27).

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
"Merged" is not "live". On 2026-07-27 one swarm sub-agent ran 26,683,114
rounds in 3.5h and wrote 9.1 GB into logs/app.log. The fix (chassis
no-progress breaker + bounded SubTaskSpec defaults) is committed, but a
long-lived server keeps running the code it was STARTED with — the running
processes predated the commit and were still emitting the unbounded
``Round N/∞`` shape hours later.

The project already learned this the hard way with the LoopWatch non-blocking
logging fix, which was only declared effective after a post-restart
faulthandler dump PROVED it. This script is the same discipline for the
runaway guards, made repeatable.

It is deliberately EVIDENCE-BASED and does NOT require the incident to recur:
every check reads either the live code the process would load, or the log
surface an operator actually watches.

USAGE
    python tests/_acceptance_runaway_guards.py            # after a restart
    python tests/_acceptance_runaway_guards.py --json     # machine-readable

Exit code 0 = all checks passed; 1 = at least one FAILED.
