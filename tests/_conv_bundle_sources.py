"""tests/_conv_bundle_sources.py — resolve which shipped JS files a node
harness must eval to get a symbol defined, using the PRODUCTION bundle list.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`static/js/core/conversations.js` has been progressively decomposed (epic
pt_3879f00e sub-part 2: slice 3 pulled the persist/freshness/rebase helper
cluster into `core/conv_persist_helpers.js`, slice 4 the image hydrator, slice 5
`_applySettingsToConv`, ...). Every slice moved symbols OUT of that file while
keeping runtime behaviour identical, because the bundler concatenates the pieces
in a declared order.

Eleven node-harness guards hard-coded `core/conversations.js` as "the file that
defines these symbols" and eval'd it standalone. Each extraction slice therefore
broke a batch of them at once: the harness eval'd a file that no longer contains
the symbol, and the guard failed with a confusing shape (`typeof X !== 'function'`
or `substring not found`) that looks like a product regression but is pure
harness drift. That is the 8th recurrence of the "guard anchored on a path
instead of a symbol" family in this project.

THE FIX (single source of truth, not 11 copies)
-----------------------------------------------
`lib/js_bundler._BUNDLE_FILES` is the PRODUCTION load order — the same list the
browser gets. So instead of guessing a filename, a harness asks:

    sources_defining('_trimMsgForPersist')   -> ordered abs paths to eval

which searches the bundle's core files for the definition and returns every file
that must be eval'd, IN BUNDLE ORDER, so bare cross-file references resolve
exactly as they do at runtime. When a future slice moves the symbol again, these
guards follow it automatically instead of going red.

Deliberately reads the bundler's own list rather than globbing the directory:
globbing would silently pick up a file the bundle does NOT ship (a leftover, a
vendored copy) and eval it, which is how a guard ends up testing code that never
reaches a user.

    """Every shipped JS file, in the order the browser ends up executing it.

    BOTH production manifests, not just the core one. `_BUNDLE_FILES` becomes
    `bundle-<hash>.js` (eager, in the page) and `_DEFERRED_FILES` becomes
    `feature-<hash>.js`, which `feature-loader.js` (itself IN the core bundle)
    injects on demand. So core always precedes deferred at runtime, and
    concatenating the two lists in that order is the real execution sequence —
    both bundles are plain concatenated <script>s sharing one window scope, so
    a deferred file may legitimately reference a core symbol.

    Core-only was a SCAN-SURFACE BUG, not a scoping choice: 21 deferred files
    (all of paper/*, project-brain*, orchestration*, image-gen*, task-mode)
    were invisible, so a lookup for a symbol living in one of them fell into
    the "not defined by any bundled file" branch and was reported as a PRODUCT
    REGRESSION. Measured 2026-07-28: `_activeReviewLang` (paper/report.js),
    `_loadPaperLibrary` (paper/library.js) and `_refreshAttention`
    (project-brain.js) all produced "the implementation was REMOVED" while the
    files were on disk and shipping to users — a precisely-worded false
    attribution that would send the next reader off to restore code that never
    left.
