"""qr_login_capture.py — QR-scan SSO login capture (headless server variant).

⚠️  MEASURED STATUS (2026-07-28) — READ BEFORE RUNNING
-----------------------------------------------------
This path has been run twice end-to-end and did NOT yield credentials:
the QR was verified on screen and DELIVERED to the operator (as an image), the
operator scanned it and confirmed in 大象 both times, and yet **this script's
headless context saw ZERO cookie change** for the whole window —
``auth_sources`` stayed ``enabled=False cookie_count=0``, no ``login detected``
/ ``SUCCESS`` line was ever emitted, and ``ctxId`` / ``ctxId-<client_id>``
remained byte-identical to the pre-scan baseline (never refreshed by the
server). No SSO event other than our own QR polling appeared.

What that DOES establish: the "QR had expired" hypothesis is disproven — the
second attempt was scanned immediately after the operator saw a freshly
refreshed code.

What it does NOT establish: WHY the confirmation did not flow back to this
context. Candidate directions — device/IP context binding, a PKCE constraint on
which endpoint may confirm, headless fingerprinting — are ALL UNVERIFIED. Do
not treat any of them as the cause, and do not conclude "QR login cannot cross
phone → headless" either: QR login is *designed* for two separate ends and
works that way every day; only this particular run is known to have failed.

So: running this again unchanged is unlikely to help. Investigate one of the
candidate directions first (e.g. compare against a headful run, or watch the
SSO poll XHR for a status transition), then change the script accordingly.
The alternative path is for a human to log in in their OWN browser and paste
the cookie via Settings → 需要登录的来源.

How it works
------------
The SSO login wall on sankuai.com is QR-based (ssosv.sankuai.com/sson/login).
A headless server has no display — but the QR can be SHOWN to the user
remotely: we screenshot it into ``static/tmp/`` (served by the app's built-in
static route), the user scans it with 大象 on their phone, and the login
completes INSIDE this script's Playwright context. We then persist the
resulting session cookies into lib/auth_sources — exactly where the fetch
pipeline's authenticated replay expects them.

Reuses tofu_search.fetch.interactive_login's core idea (wait-for-login-cookie
→ capture), replacing "headful window" with "screenshotted QR + poll".

Security posture:
  * cookie VALUES are never printed or logged (names only);
  * on success we audit_log('cookie_capture', source='qr_login');
  * the QR PNG is deleted on completion (a used login QR is useless anyway).

Usage (usually via nohup so the chat turn can return the QR link first):

    Geometry alone is NOT sufficient and an earlier version of this gate proved
    it: the login page carries a large brand illustration on the left

    test, so the gate passed while the password form was on screen — exactly
    the failure it was written to prevent.

    \u6247\u7801 / \u4e8c\u7ef4\u7801). The brand art lives outside that card, and the password
