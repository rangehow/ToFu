"""Shared pytest fixtures for the Tofu test suite.

Two independent fixture families live here:

  * ``flask_client`` / ``flask_app`` — a Quart (Flask-shim) test client over
    the REAL ``server.app``, consumed by ``tests/test_api_integration.py``,
    ``tests/test_conversation_search.py`` and any other API integration test.
    Importing ``server`` (in ``flask_app``) installs the Flask→Quart shim
    BEFORE any ``routes.*`` import, which is also what keeps
    ``routes/push.py``'s ``@push_bp.websocket`` from crashing collection with
    ``AttributeError: 'Blueprint' object has no attribute 'websocket'``.
  * ``_reset_global_config`` — snapshots/restores the tofu_search global
    ``SearchConfig`` singleton around every test so ``configure()`` mutations
    don't leak between tests.

Design notes for the API client family:
  * Each session gets a fresh, isolated SQLite DB via ``TOFU_DB_PATH`` → no
    PostgreSQL required, no cross-test contamination.
  * The app is imported lazily AFTER env-vars are set so
    ``lib.database._core`` picks SQLite at import time.
  * Default auth mode is ``open`` (the production default) so client tests
    act as an authenticated local principal without plumbing a token. A test
    that needs the credential gate marks itself ``@pytest.mark.auth_mode(
    "private")``; the ``_auth_mode_override`` fixture applies + restores it.

#
# pytest imports this conftest before it collects any test module. Several
# test files do top-level ``from routes... import X`` / ``import lib...``
# which transitively hits ``routes/push.py``'s ``@push_bp.websocket`` — an
# attribute that only exists once ``server._install_flask_shim()`` has
# pointed ``sys.modules['flask']`` at Quart. Installing the shim here (at
# conftest import) makes every test file's module-level imports safe,
# regardless of collection order, without forcing the full app build (that
# stays lazy in the ``flask_app`` fixture). The shim is idempotent, so the
# later ``import server`` re-runs it harmlessly.

    # build). We must set the SQLite env BEFORE this import so the DB layer

#
# Rule: the test process may only operate on a DB that is unmistakably a TEST
# DB. We re-read the backend the DB layer ACTUALLY resolved (``_core._BACKEND``
# / ``_core.PG_DBNAME`` / ``_core.DB_PATH``) — not just the env — because env
# and frozen-at-import globals can disagree. A PG backend is allowed ONLY when
# the operator explicitly set ``TOFU_ALLOW_PG_TESTS=1`` AND the target DB name

# style. Under Quart that raises ``TypeError: 'AppContext' object does not
# support the context manager protocol`` and previously failed 50+ tests.

# ─── Safety net: restore NC-patched source files a crashed test left dirty ──
#
# A family of "negative-control" tests physically PATCH a shipped source file
# on disk (``_patch_restore``: write a neutered variant → run → restore
# byte-identical in a ``finally``). If that test is KILLED mid-patch — a
# per-test timeout, an xdist worker crash, a KeyboardInterrupt — its ``finally``
# never runs and the shipped source is left in its NEUTERED state, which then
# fails EVERY later test that imports it (the corruption cascade that stuck
# ``_effective_status`` / ``pending_proposals`` in their NC forms). This
# autouse fixture is the belt: it snapshots each known NC-target source once,
# and after every test RESTORES any that differ from the snapshot — so a
# crashed patch can poison at most the one test that crashed, never the rest of
# the session (and never the working tree after the run). Cheap: a handful of
# small files, str-compared, only rewritten on a mismatch.
# Every shipped source that ANY negative-control test still byte-patches on
# disk (via a legacy ``_patch_restore`` or an inline ``open(..,'w')``). Keep
# this in sync with an audit of on-disk NC writers — a target NOT listed here
# is UNPROTECTED: a crashed patch leaves it poisoned for the rest of the
# session (this is exactly how ``_persist.py``'s vertical-relocation line was
# left neutered, cascading into every later importer). The durable fix is to
# migrate the NC to ``tests/_nc_harness.py`` (in-memory, never writes disk);
# this belt is the backstop for any not-yet-migrated on-disk NC.

# ─── Tier-marker safety net ───────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The suite selects tiers by marker: ``make test-unit`` runs ``-m unit``,
# ``make test-api`` runs ``-m api``, and ``make ci`` runs unit+api. A test
# with NO tier marker (unit / api / visual / slow / live_llm) is therefore
# collected by ``make test-all`` but SILENTLY SKIPPED by every standard CI
# target — so a broken unmarked test can rot undetected. Historically ~58%
# of the suite was unmarked.
#
# This hook closes that gap: any test missing a tier marker is auto-tagged
# ``unit`` so it lands in the default CI tiers, and the set of offending
# FILES is reported once as a warning (so the omission stays visible and
# authors are nudged to add the right marker — api/visual/slow where the
# default ``unit`` is wrong). New unmarked tests can never again vanish
# from CI.

#  (b) Self-healing purge of leaked TEST conversations
# ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Several tests deliberately write to the REAL database the app serves from,
# because the DB layer's backend/path globals are frozen at import time and an
# ambient ``TOFU_DB_BACKEND=postgres`` env (common on dev/CI hosts) defeats the
# session SQLite ``setdefault`` above. Those rows otherwise leak straight into
# the user's sidebar:
#   * the endpoint-parity tests seed conversations with ids ``parity-*``
#     (titles ``parity`` / ``parity-live``);
#   * ``test_api_integration`` saves ``test-conv-*`` / ``test-minimal-*`` and
#     starts chats under ``test-conv`` / ``test-endpoint``;
#   * the visual E2E suite drives a live browser that creates real
#     conversations whose first message is a fixed, recognisable string.
#
# This autouse SESSION fixture purges those rows at session start (healing
# junk a prior crashed run left behind) AND session end (cleaning this run),
# regardless of which test path created them. It is deliberately
# PATTERN-GATED — it only ever deletes rows whose id matches a test-only
# prefix or whose content is one of the distinctive synthetic E2E strings — so
# it can never touch a genuine user conversation. Best-effort: any failure is
# logged, never raised, and never fails a test.

# this conftest, so every visual test errored at setup and the cleanup the
# module docstring promised never ran (the source of the leaked sidebar

# so they add ZERO cost to unit/api runs. They skip cleanly when Playwright or
# a Chromium build is unavailable. The live server reuses the proven
# in-thread-Hypercorn boot from ``tests/test_sdk_e2e.py``; it serves the SAME
# process app (and DB), so the ``page`` fixture cleans up every conversation it
# creates via a before/after id snapshot-diff (the precise complement to the
