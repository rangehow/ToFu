"""Guard: NEW agentic capabilities ride lib/agent_loop.run_agent_loop.

WHY
---
Charter decision (owner, 2026-07-27, "Agent 能力复用铁律"): this project is
no longer a pure conversational agent — new agent-driven features MUST be
built on the shared chassis (``run_agent_loop`` + ``AbortSignal``), and new
PRIVATE multi-round tool-calling loops / private abort plumbing are
forbidden. History shows why: ``agent_verdict`` was hand-copied 4× before
being forced into one module; a decision without a ratchet is dead text
within three months.

This suite is the RATCHET, in three parts:

1. AST heuristic — a ``while`` loop whose body BOTH calls an LLM turn
   (``dispatch_stream`` / ``stream_llm_response`` / …, underscore prefixes
   normalized) AND handles tool calls (``tool_calls`` / ``execute_tool`` /
   …) IS the classic copy-paste agent-loop shape. Finding one in any
   tracked file outside the grandfathered set fails the build. (Known blind
   spot, accepted: a loop that delegates the LLM turn to a helper in
   another function — the endpoint driver shape — is not caught here; those
   are pinned by part 2's signatures instead.)
2. Grandfather signatures — the three pre-decision private loops (chat
   orchestrator, endpoint driver, swarm sub-agent) are pinned by a
   file-specific code token PLUS the absence of a ``run_agent_loop``
   import. Migrating one onto the chassis breaks its pin and turns this
   test red until the entry is removed — the list only shrinks.
3. Adoption ratchet — the number of files importing ``run_agent_loop`` must
   never decrease (currently 8: paper report/qa/survey/insight/ideate/
   recommend, scheduler timer, motion-video scene author).

NEUTER evidence (manual):
  * a probe file under lib/ containing ``while True: … dispatch_stream(…)``
    + ``msg['tool_calls']`` handling turns test 1 red naming the file:line;
  * adding ``from lib.agent_loop import run_agent_loop`` to a grandfathered
    file turns test 2 red (import detected) until the entry is removed.
