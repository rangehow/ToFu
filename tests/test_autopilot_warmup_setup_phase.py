"""Backend regression: Autopilot names the pre-stream ("warm-up") window.

WHY
---
Diagnosis (debug/autopilot_warmup_window_probe.py, 12 real runs): between
``autopilot_vu_start`` and the VU sub-task's first orchestrator phase
(``llm_thinking`` / ``waiting_model``) there is a genuinely SILENT window —
measured 2.5–26.7s — during which ``run_virtual_user`` resolves the objective
(DB read), assembles the message list and builds the sub-task. Nothing was
emitted, so the VU bubble sat on the bare "Autopilot…" placeholder with no
attribution of what was blocking.

The fix emits ``working`` phases wrapped as ``autopilot_vu_event`` (the SAME
envelope ``_VUEventForwarder`` uses) at those pre-stream steps, so the bubble
names the step and the frontend's existing ``working`` phase branch renders it.

This drives the REAL ``run_virtual_user`` with the LLM turn stubbed and asserts:
  1. two attributed ``working`` setup phases are emitted, carrying vuMsgId, and
  2. BOTH land BEFORE the sub-task's ``_run_single_turn`` is invoked (i.e. they
     fill the silent window, not after streaming starts).

NC (bites): neuter ``_emit_vu_setup_phase`` to a no-op (the pre-fix state) and
assert NO setup phases are captured — proving the assertions discriminate.
