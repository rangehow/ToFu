"""Drift guard for bootstrap.py's conda-forge dependency-repair list.

Tofu has historically maintained THREE parallel dependency lists — install.sh,
bootstrap.py's ``_CONDA_PYTHON_DEPS``, and requirements.txt — and they drift.
install.sh has its own drift guard; bootstrap.py's did not, and its conda list
had already fallen behind: it shipped only transitive ``flask`` (never the
actual ``quart``/``hypercorn`` ASGI stack the server runs on), and lacked
``orjson`` (REQUIRED for the SSE snapshot) and ``sqlalchemy`` (imported
unconditionally in the chat hot-path). On a CentOS-7-class host where the conda
repair path is the ONLY one that works (pip manylinux wheels crash on glibc
2.17), that meant the server could never boot after a dep repair.

This test locks two invariants:
  1. Every boot-critical package (``_CRITICAL_BOOT_PACKAGES``) is present in
     ``_CONDA_PYTHON_DEPS`` — so the conda repair path installs what boot needs.
  2. Every boot-critical package is also DECLARED in requirements.txt — so the
     guard tracks the real requirement, not an invented name, and the two lists
     stay coherent.

Pure text/parse over the repo files; no DB, no network, no conda.
