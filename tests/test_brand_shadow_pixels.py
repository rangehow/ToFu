"""Brand-area PIXEL guards — the mascot's ground shadow must actually be PAINTED.

WHY A SEPARATE, BROWSER-BACKED SUITE
------------------------------------
tests/test_brand_wordmark_parity.py resolves the CSS cascade in Python. That is
the right tool for "which rule wins", but it is structurally blind to "did this
reach the screen": a rule can resolve to `content:""` + a gradient and still
paint nothing (clipped by an ancestor, covered by a sibling, zero-sized, or
positioned outside the visible box). The mascot's ground shadow is exactly that
kind of decoration — nothing about it is observable except pixels.

The check is a differential render: screenshot the brand area with the shadow
live, screenshot it again with `.welcome-icon::before{content:none}`, and diff.
Any surviving difference IS the shadow, so the assertion cannot pass vacuously.
Both the pixel count AND the location are asserted — a shadow that renders in
the wrong place (e.g. drifting to a positioned ancestor because `.welcome-icon`
lost `position:relative`) is a defect this must catch, not a pass.

TWO HARNESS TRAPS, both hit while writing this (they are why this file inlines
the stylesheet and settles layout before shooting):

1. STALE / UNPARSED EXTERNAL CSS. Loading `styles.css` via `<link>` from a
   file:// page left `document.styleSheets` unreadable, and probes disagreed
   with what was on screen. Inlining the stylesheet into a `<style>` tag removes
   the loader from the experiment entirely.
2. INJECTING STYLES TOO EARLY. `add_style_tag` immediately after `goto` raced
   the first layout/paint, and the "shadow off" screenshot came back identical
   to "shadow on" — reporting a false ZERO for a shadow that was in fact
   painting ~1300 pixels. Every screenshot here waits for fonts + a settle
   delay, and the neuter is baked into the page's own markup rather than
   injected after load.

Skips (never silently passes) when Chromium is unavailable.
