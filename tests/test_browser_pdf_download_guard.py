"""Guard: the browser-bridge provider must REFUSE binary/PDF URLs.

Background — real bug: when Browser Bridge mode is on, a server-side fetch
failure on a PDF (403/429/timeout/oversize) fell through to the browser
fallback, which opens the URL in a real Chrome tab. Navigating a tab to a PDF
makes Chrome's download manager save the file to the USER's machine (the
mysterious ``sfbookvNr.pdf`` downloads) AND returns no scrapable text, so the
server couldn't parse it anyway. PDFs/binaries must be fetched server-side
only (``_extract_pdf_text`` in-memory), never routed through the extension.

These tests pin ``_ChatuiBrowserProvider.fetch_url`` / ``fetch_html``: for a
binary URL they must short-circuit to ``None`` WITHOUT ever calling the
underlying extension transport (``fetch_url_via_browser`` /
``send_browser_command``). The NC: remove the guard and the transport IS
reached for a PDF → these tests fail.
