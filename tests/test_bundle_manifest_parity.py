"""Closed-system parity test for the JS-bundler allowlist trap (CLAUDE.md §3.2.1).

The bundler's "which file is an app script" decision is declared in FIVE
places that must all agree, or a file silently loads as a no-op (missing from
a manifest → stripped-but-not-rebundled) or double-loads (in a manifest AND
its raw tag survives → duplicate-IIFE crash):

  1. ``_BUNDLE_FILES``        (core bundle)        — lib/js_bundler.py
  2. ``_DEFERRED_FILES``      (deferred bundle)    — lib/js_bundler.py
  3. ``_APP_SCRIPTS_RE`` strip set                 — routes/common.py
  4. ``_CRITICAL_FILES`` ⊆ ``_BUNDLE_FILES``       — lib/js_bundler.py
  5. ``_DEFERRED_ENTRY_POINTS`` ↔ deferred sources — lib/js_bundler.py

The deferred feature bundle WIDENED this trap (a file added to _DEFERRED_FILES
but forgotten in the strip set, or vice versa, is a new silent-orphan variant).
This test asserts the whole system is closed so a future edit that breaks any
edge fails loudly here instead of in production.

Only ONE top-level app script is intentionally unbundled — ``relay-admin.js``
(loads solely on the standalone ``/admin`` page). Rather than a bare exemption
that would let a genuinely-orphaned new file hide behind it, we assert the
invariant that MAKES it safe: it is a ``<script>`` tag in ``static/admin.html``
and NOT in ``index.html``.
