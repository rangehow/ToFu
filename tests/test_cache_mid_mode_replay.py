"""Offline replay harness — compare mid-anchor LAYOUT modes (current vs drop)
WITHOUT a live gateway, by MODELLING Anthropic's 20-block-lookback cache
extension over a realistic tool-loop sequence.

WHY A MODEL (and its honest limits)
===================================
The real cache read/write per round come from Anthropic's gateway and cannot be
observed offline. But the MECHANISM was pinned from 734 live CacheRoundRecords
(this turn's investigation):
  - Anthropic extends a prior cache entry only if a breakpoint sits within ~20
    CONTENT BLOCKS behind it (the lookback window).
  - The prefix is read back (warm) up to the FARTHEST breakpoint that chains
    back to block 0 through a sequence of ≤20-block hops; everything past the
    last reachable hop is re-written (cold) that round.
  - The live floor-collapse (read ≈ 74k = system+tools only) happens on the
    rounds the mid stone JUMPS to a fresh position that cannot chain back to the
    system prefix (system→mid hop > 20 blocks), so ONLY the system prefix is
    read back.

This harness reproduces THAT reachability rule from the marker BLOCK positions
``add_cache_breakpoints`` actually places (via marker_signature), for each mode,
and counts the rounds whose warm-reachable frontier collapses to the head
(system-only). It is a MODEL of the extension rule, not a gateway measurement —
so it decides which layout is *structurally* better (fewer modelled collapses),
and the LIVE A/B (deferred, post-restart) confirms the token numbers.
