"""Tests for lib/llm_dispatch/cache_settle.py — cache write-visibility settle gate.

Guards the dominant floor-miss fix (Anthropic SDK #1451 write-visibility race):
a big request on a conversation whose PRIOR big round's stream ended <window ago
briefly waits so the prior cache WRITE is visible before this round reads the
prefix back. Pure timing logic — no DB, no network, no real sleep in the hot
assertions (we inject ``now`` and stub the sleeper).

Invariants under test:
  1. Rapid same-conv second request waits the REMAINDER of the window.
  2. Enough-elapsed second request waits ZERO (write already settled).
  3. FIRST request of a conv (no prior stream end) never waits.
  4. Sub-threshold (small) prefixes never wait.
  5. Different conversations don't gate each other.
  6. Wait is hard-capped by settle_max_wait_ms.
  7. Abort-aware: a tripped abort_check breaks the wait early.
  8. Env-off (TOFU_CACHE_SETTLE=0) → no wait, no recording.
  9. Adaptive: a long prior round (elapsed > window) waits zero.
 10. NEUTER: without recording the prior stream end, the race is NOT mitigated
     (the second rapid request would send immediately — proving record/measure
     is load-bearing).
