"""tests/test_cache_tail_breakpoint_openai_wire.py — PIN a known, unfixed defect.

WHAT IS PINNED
==============
On a NON-Anthropic wire, an agent tool loop loses its conversation-TAIL cache
breakpoint whenever the trailing assistant turn carries ``tool_calls`` with
EMPTY ``content`` — the shape a model produces when it calls a tool without
writing prose first. Only 2 of the 4 markers land (system + last tool
definition); the rolling tail marker, which is the single highest-value one
because it covers the growing prefix, is silently dropped.

Consequence: whether a round can cache its conversation body depends on whether
the model happened to narrate before calling a tool. That is not a property any
cache strategy should hinge on.

WHY IT IS UNFIXED — both routes are closed, each for a DIFFERENT reason
=======================================================================
Route A — mark the assistant turn on the OpenAI wire. **Closed by the OpenAI
  schema itself**, which is a repo-verifiable fact, not a gateway behaviour:
  ``prepare_request`` (lib/llm/_sse_core.py) only invokes
  ``openai_body_to_anthropic`` when ``api_protocol == 'anthropic'``; on every
  other wire the body is serialised VERBATIM. In that body an assistant turn's
  ``content`` is a plain ``str`` and ``tool_calls`` is a list of
  ``{id, type, function{name, arguments}}`` function-call descriptors — there is
  no content BLOCK anywhere to hang ``cache_control`` on. The marker-hoisting
  logic that would rescue it (``_assistant_blocks`` in
  lib/llm/anthropic_outbound/) lives on the Anthropic path and never runs here.
  Fabricating an empty ``[{'type':'text','text':''}]`` block is explicitly
  rejected in lib/llm/cache.py Phase 0.5 (it would be a text block the model
  never wrote, and it re-introduces the str↔block representation flip that
  Phase 0.5 exists to eliminate).

Route B — switch this provider to the Anthropic wire. **NOT settled.** Probing
  the gateway produced mutually contradictory results across several rounds,
  including a physically impossible ``prompt_tokens=2`` on a 2000+ token body,
  which means the endpoint short-circuits or de-duplicates in a way that makes
  black-box cache measurement from outside unreliable. No claim about that
  endpoint's cache behaviour is asserted here, in either direction. Deciding it
  needs the gateway team's internal observability, not more outside probing.
  (Note for whoever picks this up: the base_url in
  static/provider_templates/meituan_claude_code.json is ``/v1/anthropic``, which
  returns 404 — the reachable path has an extra segment. That template has never
  served live traffic.)

SO: this file asserts ONLY the client-side marker arithmetic, which is pure
local logic. It deliberately makes NO assertion about hit rates, cached_tokens,
or any gateway response. If a future change makes the tail marker land in the
empty-content case, `test_openai_wire_loses_the_tail_breakpoint` fails — that is
the intended signal to delete this file, not to update the number.
