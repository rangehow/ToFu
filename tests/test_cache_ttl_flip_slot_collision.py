"""Guard: the ttl-flip detector must not fire on marker-slot COLLISIONS.

Production evidence (2026-07-26, 7-day apiRounds scan, epic pt_6ac5febf):
``markers_ttl_flipped`` reported 358 "cache TTL marker flipped" breaks, ALL on
one slot key ``msg:tool_result(toolu_bdrk)`` and ALL on aws.claude-opus-4.8.

Root cause is NOT a ttl flip. ``_brief`` keys a tool_result slot on
``tool_use_id[:10]``, and AWS Bedrock mints ids shaped ``toolu_bdrk_01ABC…`` —
so the first 10 chars are IDENTICAL for every tool_result on that line and all
of them collapse into ONE slot key. The stable mid marker (ttl='1h') and the
rolling tail marker (ttl='') then land on two DIFFERENT tool_result messages
that share the collapsed key, so the slot's value SET is ``{'1h',''}``. As the
tail rolls forward the set membership churns ('1h' → {'1h',''} → '' …) and the
set-compare reads that as a ttl VALUE flip on a surviving slot.

Measured: 790 rounds carried a multi-valued slot and in **100% of them** the
value set was exactly ``{'1h',''}`` — i.e. one stable + one tail marker, never
a real 5m↔1h reconfiguration.

Cost of the bug is diagnostic, not billing: it mislabels real misses (which
have their own cause) as a client-side "cache re-keyed" verdict, and — because
``<ttl-flip>`` is a CULPRIT token — it also blocks the honest "server-side
PROVEN" verdict. That is exactly the attribution channel epic pt_a475804a
depends on, so a poisoned label here costs future investigations.

Fix under test: slot keys must be collision-resistant (full tool id, not a
10-char prefix), so two distinct tool_results never share a slot.
