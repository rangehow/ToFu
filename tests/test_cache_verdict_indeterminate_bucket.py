"""A zero-read rebuild must not be filed alongside genuine cache hits.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
``no_break`` used to mean two different things: "the cache was reused fine"
AND "the detector reached no conclusion". They are not the same claim, and
conflating them let real spend hide behind a healthy-looking bucket.

MEASURED MECHANISM: all three predicates in ``_classify_break`` carry
``and not was_compaction``, so a COMPACTED round with a large zero-read write
is structurally exempt from every gate and falls through to the no-break path.
The exemption is correct for the detector's RETURN value — a compaction
legitimately rebuilds its prefix and must not be blamed on the gateway — but
wrong for the LEDGER, where those tokens were really paid for.

NOT THE MECHANISM (asserted false below, so it cannot be re-adopted): an
earlier version of this fix claimed a zero-read PREDECESSOR starved the gates,
making a run of consecutive misses collapse to one counted miss.
``prev_prefix_tokens`` is prev_read + prev_write, so a miss predecessor with a
large write still clears ``no_reuse``'s threshold — verified directly against
``_classify_break``, which returns ``no_reuse=True`` on exactly that shape.

The fix is at the LANDING SITE (how an unconcluded round is NAMED), NOT in the
detection thresholds. Loosening a gate would make a genuinely cold or
legitimately-rebuilt prefix report as a miss — a false positive traded for a
false negative.

GUARDS
  * A compacted zero-read rebuild is bucketed ``indeterminate`` and counted.
  * COMPLEMENT — a genuine cache HIT is never dragged in by the new rule.
  * COMPLEMENT — a first round (no predecessor) stays a cold start, not an
    unknown: it had nothing to read back.
  * COMPLEMENT — a small write is not an indeterminate miss.
  * The predicate is evaluated by IMPORTING the production terms, never by a
    hand-copied mirror — a mirror drifts silently and passes anyway.
  * The detector's RETURN value is unchanged (``None``). Only the recorded
    bucket moves — telemetry changes, product behaviour does not.
