"""TTL expiry must bucket as its OWN verdict — not as a client body change.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
``_resolve_break_cause`` has emitted ``'TTL expiry (>5min gap, prompt
unchanged)'`` for any >300s gap since the elapsed-computation fix. But
``classify_verdict`` only ever matched ``'ttl marker flipped'`` and
``'new cache key'`` — it never matched the substring ``'ttl expiry'``.

Net effect measured on real traffic (logs/app.log [CacheRoundRecord], the
production classifier's own per-round output):

  * 73 zero-readback rounds with a byte-identical prefix and gap > 300s were
    bucketed ``body_change`` (n=37) or ``other`` (n=34).
  * ``body_change`` reads as "the CLIENT changed the bytes" — the exact
    mislabel this whole detector family exists to prevent. 95 of those 101
    rounds carried ``body_identical=True`` with ZERO culprits, i.e. the
    classifier had already PROVEN the bytes identical and then filed the round
    under a client body change anyway.
  * Cost consequence: 1,516 CNY of ordinary, UNAVOIDABLE cache rebuilds (the
    entry legitimately expired after 5+ minutes of idle) were being counted as
    recoverable waste. Removing them raises the upstream-gateway share of the
    genuinely avoidable spend from 86.1% to 91.2% — i.e. this mislabel was
    actively distorting where the money was thought to be going.

A TTL rebuild is NOT waste: the cache entry expired on its own schedule and
had to be re-created. Bucketing it honestly is what lets a cost dashboard
subtract it instead of chasing it.

GUARDS
  * The cause string the backend actually emits at >300s buckets as
    ``ttl_expiry`` under BOTH return keys it can arrive with
    (``no_cache_reuse`` → was body_change, ``server_side`` → was other).
  * COMPLEMENT: a short-gap byte-identical miss still buckets
    ``upstream_identical`` — the fix must not swallow the gateway class, which
    is where 91% of the recoverable money is.
  * COMPLEMENT: a real client body change still buckets ``body_change``.
  * The TTL branch is reached by CALLING the real backend fn, never by
    hardcoding its wording (the drift trap this file's sibling already fights).
