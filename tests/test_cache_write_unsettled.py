"""Cache WRITE-VISIBILITY (cold-write) settle + detector attribution suite.

BACKGROUND (LIVE evidence, gathered this turn via real gateway probes — see the
JOURNAL entry):
  A freshly-WRITTEN Anthropic cache entry is not readable for ~15–20s after the
  write (the documented anthropic-sdk-python #1451 write-visibility race). In a
  fast tool loop the next round fires ~8s later — INSIDE that window — so it
  misses and re-writes the whole prefix, and cache_read pins at the static
  floor until the loop slows enough for the write to settle. Measured live:
    • resend identical COLD prefix every 4s → miss at t=3s, miss at t=10s,
      HIT at t≈16s;
    • settle sweep (cold write → wait S → continue) → MISS at S≤14s, HIT at S≥17s.
  The strip/thinking hypotheses were FALSIFIED first: sending an identical
  tool-loop body (with a signed thinking block in history) twice read the FULL
  prefix back on the 2nd send (cache_read == the whole prefix), so thinking
  blocks ARE cached in a pure tool_result loop.

THE DEFECT:
  lib/llm_dispatch/cache_settle.py already implements the settle gate and is
  wired into dispatch (api.py), BUT its window is 1500ms / cap 4000ms — ~10x
  too short to bridge the measured ~15–20s cold-write latency. On an 8s-gap
  loop elapsed(8s) > window(1.5s) → it waits ZERO and never helps.

THE FIX under test:
  A. cache_settle gains a COLD-WRITE-AWARE window. record_stream_end learns
     whether the finishing round was a COLD WRITE (large cache_write, ~0 read —
     the entry that actually needs time to become visible). Only THEN does the
     next same-conv send wait the long cold window (default 18000ms, capped at
     20000ms). A warm round (prefix already cached / merely extended) keeps the
     original short window so tool-loop throughput is not crippled. Env knobs:
     TOFU_CACHE_SETTLE_COLD_MS / TOFU_CACHE_SETTLE_COLD_MAX_MS.
  B. detect_cache_break names an in-window floor-miss cache_write_unsettled
     (its own bucket) instead of laundering it into upstream_identical /
     body_change: a byte-identical, same-routing read-collapse that arrives
     within the cold-write settle window since this conv's prior COLD write is
     the visibility race, NOT a server fault.
