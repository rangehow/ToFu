"""tests/test_chrome_store_manifest_parity.py — the store build must declare
exactly the permissions the shipped code actually needs.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``docs/chrome-web-store/manifest.store.json`` is a HAND-MAINTAINED trim of
``browser_extension/manifest.json``: the store build swaps it in
(``scripts/package_extension.sh --store``) so reviewers are not asked to
justify permissions the code never calls. Two independent lists that must
agree, edited by hand, with the consequence of disagreement only visible
AFTER a store review — that is a drift generator.

It had already drifted, in the direction that hurts users:

  * ``downloads`` was MISSING from the store manifest while
    ``background.js::cmdDownload`` really calls ``chrome.downloads.download``
    and ``download`` is one of the extension's wire commands. Shipping that
    build meant the ``download`` command threw at runtime — for a user who
    installed from the store, silently and with no way to diagnose it.
  * the store manifest was pinned at version 4.3.0 while the shipped manifest
    had moved to 4.5.0, so the store build would carry 4.5.0's CODE under a
    4.3.0 label. ``package_extension.sh`` reads the version from whichever
    manifest it ships, so the zip name was wrong too.

THE INVARIANT
-------------
**The store manifest is DERIVED, not remembered.** These guards compute the
required permission set from the extension source and compare — so the next
time someone adds a ``chrome.X`` call, the guard names the permission they
forgot instead of a store reviewer (or a user) finding it later.

A NOTE ON ``activeTab`` — WHY "ZERO CALLS" IS THE WRONG TEST
------------------------------------------------------------
``activeTab`` has NO API surface: ``chrome.activeTab`` does not exist, so
grepping for calls to it always returns zero and proves nothing. It is a
*capability* permission, and per Chrome's own tabs documentation it is granted
only **on a user gesture** (clicking the action, a keyboard command, a context
menu) — and it exists here to widen ``tabs.captureVisibleTab`` to sensitive
targets (``chrome://`` pages, other extensions' pages, ``data:`` URLs).

Measured against this extension: there is no ``commands`` key, no
``context_menus`` key, and ``popup.js`` never triggers a capture. Every
screenshot arrives through ``executeAndReport`` from the server long-poll, so
NO user gesture ever precedes one. ``activeTab`` therefore can never actually
be granted, while ``<all_urls>`` (already declared) is what makes
``captureVisibleTab`` work for ordinary pages. Dropping it is right — but for
the reason above, not for a call count. The guard below encodes that reasoning
so nobody "restores" it by grepping.
