"""tests/test_claude_effort_rung_parity.py — every rung is SAID, and both outbound paths say it identically.

Regression class pinned
=======================
Closes the last hole in the Opus 5 adaptation, and it sat on the DEFAULT rung.

``lib/llm/body/_build.py`` carried ``if _effort and _effort != 'medium'`` —
``medium`` was explicitly excluded and never reached the wire. That exclusion
was CORRECT when it was written: medium WAS the model default, so omitting it
was a free optimization. Claude Opus 5 moved the default to ``high``, and the
line's meaning silently changed from "save a few bytes" to "quietly upgrade
the user's Med to High".

``index.html`` marks ``data-depth="medium"`` as ``active`` on BOTH the desktop
(:795) and mobile (:1708) selectors — this is the rung most users ride on
every single turn.

LIVE gateway evidence (yuju-claude-opus-5-evaDaily via aigc.sankuai.com,
identical prompt, max_tokens=8000, adaptive thinking, n=6 per arm,
2026-07-26):

    Med as sent (effort DROPPED)  [2013,2336,2778,2847,3157,3353]  median 2812.5
    Med explicit (effort=medium)  [1236,1296,1845,1865,2556,3723]  median 1855.0
                                                            ratio ≈ 1.52x

Same root cause as the two fixes before it (8d7b6911 outbound thinking-off,
43dd1ecd inbound thinking semantics): an "omission implies the default"
assumption that Opus 5 invalidated.

★ The parity half is the durable part
-------------------------------------
Tofu builds a Claude request body in TWO places that must agree:

  1. ``lib.llm.body.build_body``                       — the primary path
  2. ``lib.llm_dispatch.api._readjust_thinking_params`` — the model-SWAP path
     (fallback chain / load balance), which pops every thinking key and
     re-derives them for the new model.

Before this fix they DISAGREED on exactly this rung: build_body dropped
``medium``, the swap path kept it. Identical (model, enabled, depth) input,
two different wires — which is a bug outright, not a style difference.
``test_both_outbound_paths_agree_on_every_rung`` is the guard that stops them
re-diverging; it is deliberately a cross-product over rungs x models rather
than a spot check, because the last divergence hid on one single rung.

Scope: pre-4.7 Claude keeps the byte-identical omit-medium wire. Those models
really do still default to medium, so sending it changes nothing upstream, and
the whole point of this suite is that a rung is only worth stating when
omitting it would mean something ELSE.
