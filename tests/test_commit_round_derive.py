"""Per-round modified-file derivation — behaviour tests for commit_round/_derive.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
``derive_round_modified_files`` decides WHICH FILES a given agent round is
reported to have changed. Everything downstream trusts that answer: the
"files changed" bar in the UI, the round's file-history snapshot attribution,
and the undo/redo surface. Getting it wrong is a *silent* correctness failure —
the round still completes green, it just claims the wrong files.

Measured 2026-07-27 (``coverage run`` over every test that so much as mentions
``commit_round``): ``_derive.py`` at **10%**, ``_commit.py`` at **6%**. The
package was reachable only incidentally — nothing exercised its actual
decisions. That is the gap this file closes.

WHY THIS MODULE FIRST (and not the ones the epic ranked above it)
    The epic ranked ``_core_schema/_tables.py`` as priority #1 on the strength
    of "565 LOC, zero test references". Real coverage measurement says
    ``_tables.py`` is at **100%** — ``tests/test_core_schema_{groundwork,parity}``
    drive it thoroughly; the static census had merely failed to see it because
    no test names that *file*. So the epic's #1 was a false alarm, and this —
    the round-commit path it ranked #2 — is the real top gap. Recorded here
    because the next person to read the epic deserves the correction.

WHAT IS ASSERTED (behaviour, never implementation — charter discipline)
    Each test states an OUTCOME the caller depends on, so a legitimate rewrite
    of the internals keeps them green while a semantic regression turns them
    red. No source-text anchors, no private-symbol assertions.

  1. Conversation isolation — a mod stamped with ANOTHER task's id is never
     attributed to this round. This is the leak that once let a foreign file
     appear in a round's file list.
  2. Extra-root aggregation — the journal is keyed per-root, so a write to an
     extra workspace root lives in a DIFFERENT journal. Scanning only the
     primary root makes those edits invisible (the documented bug this
     function was written to fix).
  3. Timestamp fallback is a LAST resort — used only when the task owns no
     stamped mod at all, and it must set the ``used_ts_fallback`` flag so the
     caller knows the answer is heuristic.
  4. Action classification — write/patch/insert/delete map to the vocabulary
     the frontend renders; a ``run_command`` delete is distinguished from a
     modify by resolving against the mod's OWN root, not the primary.
  5. Deduplication is keyed on ``(root, path)`` — the same relative path in two
     different roots is two files, not one.
