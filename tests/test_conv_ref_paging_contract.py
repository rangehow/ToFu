"""``get_conversation`` must not promise a parameter it does not accept.

Two defects this pins, both measured on production rows before the fix:

1. **The description advertised paging that could not happen.** The tool text
   said "`before` pages backwards through the rest" and the result footer said
   "re-read with before=N", but the schema exposed only
   ``conversation_id`` / ``include_tool_details`` / ``raw`` and
   ``execute_conv_ref_tool`` never forwarded ``limit`` / ``before`` to the
   library. A model following that instruction had its argument silently
   dropped, got the IDENTICAL window back, and had no way to detect the loop —
   a precisely-worded, credible, WRONG signal.

2. **A "raw" read delivered 0.4-1.0% of the record and looked complete.** The
   window was sized by ``TRANSCRIPT_TAIL`` (60), a constant tuned for the prose
   renderer that truncates tool results as it goes. A raw record carries every
   message's full ``toolRounds``, so asking for 60 blew the budget and the
   over-limit guards demolished the window after the fact: measured 2 of 205
   messages, field-clamped, under a header that read "Messages: 2 of 205" in
   the same breath as a promise that nothing was summarized away.

The guards below assert RESULTS, never constants: the budget arithmetic,
``MAX_CHARS`` and the fitted window sizes may all be retuned without turning
these red, but a dropped paging argument or a re-broken promise fails
immediately.

The ``test_every_parameter_named_in_the_description_exists`` case is the
general one — it derives the claim from the description text itself, so it
also catches the NEXT parameter someone promises in prose without wiring.

    """A conversation too large for one window, shaped like a real one.

    Each assistant message carries a fat ``toolRounds`` payload — that is what
    makes a raw record heavy, and sizing off it is the whole point.

    The sizes are DELIBERATELY uneven, mirroring measured production rows
    (median ~9 KB, individual messages 80-100 KB, one opener 46 KB). A uniform
    fixture is too kind: with every message the same small size, ``60`` of them
    happen to fit the budget, so reverting to the prose-tuned constant would
    NOT be caught — verified, the neuter did not bite until the shape matched
    reality.

    The payload is also MANY SMALL NESTED KEYS rather than one giant string.
    That is what makes pretty-printing (``indent=2``) inflate a real record by
    ~13% (measured on production): indentation costs per line, and a deep
    dict-of-lists has thousands of them. A fixture built from one long string
    inflates by almost nothing, so it cannot detect a size probe that measures
    compact JSON while the dump is pretty-printed.
