THE SECOND HALF OF THE REPORTED SYMPTOM
---------------------------------------
The owner's complaint had two parts. The first — state converging wrongly — was
a clock-domain defect, fixed separately (charter #27). This is the second part,
which is not a latency problem at all:

  "before the backend state is fully synchronized, the frontend doesn't even
   know its state is lagging, which might lead to displaying incorrect states"

Two independent gaps produced that, and each is a case of a component that
already KNOWS something and does nothing with it:

  A. THE SERVER DETECTED STALLS AND ONLY LOGGED THEM.
     ``drift_tracker.observe_divergence`` already separates a client that is
     merely sampling late (its value is MOVING) from one that is FROZEN while
     the server advances — the "a notify frame was dropped and this tab will
     never converge" case — and marks the latter ``sustained``. But the probe
     endpoint used that verdict only to pick a log level. The server knew
     exactly which socket was stuck and left the user to discover it by
     pressing F5.

  B. THE CLIENT HAD NO CONCEPT OF ITS OWN STALENESS.
     push.js runs an 8s ping watchdog and force-closes a half-open socket, so
     "frames are not arriving" is already computed. Nothing consumed it for
     state rendering: during an outage the sidebar kept drawing a busy/idle
     verdict as settled fact.

WHAT THIS SUITE PINS

  Repair policy (pure, no hub):
    1. a sustained stall warrants a repair;
    2. a non-sustained divergence does NOT (a single missed beat is not worth a
       frame; the next notify almost always closes it);
    3. cooldown suppresses a second repair to the same socket;
    4. an empty socket id can never trigger one — an untargetable repair would
       have to be broadcast, which hits healthy tabs and MASKS the condition;
    5. a failed delivery must NOT start the cooldown, or one unlucky probe
       silences repair for the whole window.

  Transport:
    6. the hub can deliver to ONE socket by req_id, and does not touch others.

  Client confidence:
    7. it is a SEPARATE dimension — ``computeConvBusy`` must be byte-identical
       in behaviour whatever the channel health is. If a dead socket could flip
       busy to false, a running conversation would offer Send and hide Stop:
       a lost abort handle, strictly worse than the staleness being reported.
    8. a live local stream outranks channel health (bytes are arriving on that
       conv, so it cannot be stale).
    9. a timed-out / offline channel degrades an authoritative-only busy verdict
       to 'unconfirmed'.
   10. 'poor' latency stays confirmed — a slow link still delivers, and
       treating slow as stale would light the degraded UI on every mobile
       connection.

  Rendering (the part that makes it visible rather than internal plumbing):
   11. the unconfirmed flag reaches the DOM (dot + tag class);
   12. it is inside the sidebar's status hash, so a health flip actually
       repaints instead of being swallowed by the fast-path early return.

    A client is judged sustained-stalled mostly BECAUSE notify frames stopped
    arriving, i.e. because the push socket is unhealthy. Sending the correction
    back over that same socket is therefore self-defeating: when the socket
    works the repair is unnecessary, and when it is broken the repair cannot
    land. Measured, three ways:

      * HALF-OPEN SOCKET — the client object is still registered and
        ``_ws.send`` never throws, so nothing errors; the queue simply fills
        (bounded at 1000) and the peer receives nothing. ``deliver_to_socket``
        still returned True, which the caller treated as DELIVERED and used to
        arm a 300s cooldown. The client most in need of repair got a false
        success plus five minutes of silence.
      * NO SOCKET AT ALL — WebSocket blocked by a corporate proxy / tunnel.
        ``deliver_to_socket`` returns False forever, so that population is
        permanently unrepairable. It is also the population that needs the
        repair most, since it has no push channel to self-heal through.
      * HTTP IS PROVEN ALIVE — the stall is detected FROM a digest POST that
        returned 200. At the exact moment we decide to repair, the HTTP path
        has just demonstrated it works.

    So the correction rides the HTTP RESPONSE: the channel the detection signal
    arrived on is the channel the correction goes back on, and that channel is
    self-evidently up.

    This guard pins the property, not the implementation: given a hub with NO
    live sockets whatsoever, the response must still carry a correction the
    client can apply.
