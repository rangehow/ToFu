"""Regression coverage for the overnight-suspend stale-PG-connection bug.

Symptom (from production logs)
------------------------------
After the machine/FUSE mount is frozen overnight (laptop lid close / VM pause /
device disconnect) and the user reconnects the next day, the FIRST Send/Regen
fails with::

    psycopg2.OperationalError: server closed the connection unexpectedly

and the UI shows "offline" for ~16 minutes (POST /api/client-error … SLOW
965s) while the pool slowly drains its dead connections one request at a time.

Two root causes, both fixed and covered here:

1. ``_test_pg_connection`` trusted ``time.monotonic()`` to decide whether a
   pooled connection was recently-used enough to SKIP the ``SELECT 1`` probe.
   ``time.monotonic()`` FREEZES across an OS suspend, so a connection whose
   backend PG killed overnight still looked "used seconds ago" → the probe was
   skipped → a DEAD connection was handed to the request. The fix cross-checks
   the WALL clock (``_last_used_wall``), which advances across a suspend.

2. Raw ``db.execute()`` read sites (e.g. ``persist_conv_messages`` settings
   SELECT) that do NOT route through ``db_execute_with_retry`` had no reconnect
   path, so a dead pooled connection surfaced as a hard 500. ``PgConnection``
   now transparently reconnects once on a dead-connection error when the
   connection has issued no write yet.

These tests exercise the PURE logic with lightweight fakes — no live PG needed.
