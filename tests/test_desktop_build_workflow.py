"""tests/test_desktop_build_workflow.py — the desktop installer must actually
get BUILT and PUBLISHED, and its runner labels must not be allowed to rot.

WHAT THIS GUARDS
----------------
Two independent defects made "push a new version" stop producing an installer.
Both were SILENT: nothing failed, nothing was logged, and the Releases page
simply kept showing an old version while the operator built by hand.

  1. **The build only fired on a tag that a plain push never creates.**
     ``build-desktop.yml`` triggered on ``refs/tags/v*`` only. But
     ``export.py --push`` creates a tag ONLY when ``--bump`` is also passed
     (``is_release=bool(args.bump)``; see ``_git_push``). So the normal
     "export and push" produced no tag, hence no run, hence no installer —
     the automation depended on the operator remembering a flag.

  2. **A retired runner label starves instead of failing.** The matrix asked
     for ``macos-13`` (Intel). GitHub retired that image on 2025-12-08
     (actions/runner-images#13046). A retired label does not error — it is
     never scheduled. Measured on the real repo, runs 29632725079 (v0.15.0),
     29927622183 (v0.15.1) and 30001088220 (v0.15.2): the ``macOS DMG
     (x86_64)`` job sat queued with ``runner=""`` for EXACTLY 24 h, GitHub
     auto-cancelled it, and since ``release`` has ``needs: build-macos`` the
     release job went ``skipped``. Those versions built 3 of 4 platforms and
     published nothing. ``timeout-minutes: 30`` did not help: it measures
     execution time, not queue time.

  3. **A tag is a PRODUCT of releasing, not evidence of it.** The first fix
     for (1) gated on ``git ls-remote --tags``, which is wrong in both
     directions and left the reported symptom in place — see
     ``test_an_orphan_tag_does_not_block_the_release``. Worse, an orphan tag
     also mis-anchors the release itself: ``target_commitish`` is documented
     as "Unused if the Git tag already exists", so a release created on a
     stale tag ships binaries from one commit and Source-code archives from
     another. See ``test_an_orphan_tag_is_moved_to_the_built_commit``.

THE INVARIANTS PINNED HERE
--------------------------
  * The version in ``VERSION`` — not a flag the operator may forget — is what
    decides whether an installer is built and published.
  * Every ``runs-on`` label is CURRENT, and this test goes red BEFORE the
    label's published retirement date, so the rotation happens on a normal
    working day instead of being discovered as a non-release weeks later.
  * The release job cannot be reached while any platform leg is missing.

WHY A DATED ALLOWLIST RATHER THAN "IS THIS LABEL VALID"
-------------------------------------------------------
Label validity is only observable at GitHub's scheduler, which the test suite
cannot reach (and must not depend on — CI runs offline-ish and must be
deterministic). A retirement date, however, is published months ahead. Pinning
the dates locally converts "we find out when a release silently doesn't
happen" into "a test fails while there is still time to rotate".
