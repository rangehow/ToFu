"""tests/test_devices_panel_and_platform_download.py — the Devices settings
page must actually be STYLED, must paint its two lanes as one generation, and
the desktop download must name the file for the user's platform.

WHAT THIS GUARDS
----------------
Three defects, all measured on the shipped tree before this suite existed.

1. **The panel was never styled at all.** ``devices.html`` +
   ``settings/devices.js`` between them use nine classes — ``stg-desc``,
   ``stg-row``, ``stg-table``, ``stg-dim``, bare ``stg-btn``,
   ``devices-agent-row``, ``devices-offline``, ``devices-online-dot``,
   ``devices-token-row`` — and every one of them had **zero** rule in
   ``styles.css`` AND zero in ``settings.css``. So the browser fell back to
   its defaults: an unstyled ``<table>``, a system ``<button>``, ``<p>`` with
   nothing but default margin. This is not "ugly design", it is *the absence
   of design*, and no amount of tweaking existing rules could have fixed it
   because there were no existing rules.

   ``.stg-*`` is shared settings chrome and lives in ``styles.css``;
   ``.devices-*`` is page-specific and lives in ``settings.css`` (the split
   ``tests/test_settings_panels_parity.py`` enforces).

2. **Two lanes, two generations, one payload.** ``_populateDevicesTab`` reset
   ``devicesAgentsList`` to a loading line but never touched
   ``devicesTokensList``. One request fed both lanes, so the screen could show
   "loading…" above a settled "no tokens yet" — two different answers to the
   same question at the same instant.

   Worse, ``Api.desktop.devices()`` is declared ``{onError:'null'}``, which
   api.js documents as *"rejections become null"*. A dead backend therefore
   **resolves** with ``null`` and lands in ``.then``, so the ``.catch`` branch
   that painted the ⚠ line was structurally unreachable and "loading…" could
   stay on screen forever. A lane must always reach a terminal state.

3. **The download link made the user guess.** ``_desktop_download_url``
   returned only ``…/releases/latest`` — a page carrying five assets (two
   DMGs, an .exe, a .tar.gz, SHA256SUMS). The user had to know which one their
   machine takes.

   The asset names must be derived from the ONE list in
   ``scripts/release_assets.py``; a sixth hand-typed copy in a route would
   drift the moment a platform is added (and the release gates would keep
   passing, because they only know the platforms still on their own list).

THE macOS TRAP
--------------
Apple Silicon and Intel Macs are **indistinguishable from the UA string** —
Chrome and Safari both report ``Intel Mac OS X`` on an M-series machine.
Architecture is only knowable from ``Sec-CH-UA-Arch``, a high-entropy client
hint that Chromium sends only after an ``Accept-CH`` opt-in and that Safari
never sends. So when the arch is unknown the server MUST offer both DMGs
rather than pick one: guessing wrong hands the user a download that cannot
open, which is strictly worse than asking them to choose.

# THE DEFECT. The URL was assembled as
# ``/releases/latest/download/<cached filename>`` — two halves with DIFFERENT
# lifetimes glued together:
#
#   * the filename is cached here for 900 s;
#   * ``latest`` is resolved by GitHub at click time.
#
# They agree at the instant the cache is filled and diverge the moment a new
# release publishes: ``latest`` moves to the new tag, whose asset set does not
# contain the old filename. Measured against the real repo:
#
#   latest/download/Tofu-Setup-0.14.2-win64.exe   -> 200  (in current latest)
#   latest/download/Tofu-Setup-0.15.2-win64.exe   -> 404  (not in latest)
#   latest/download/Tofu-Setup-0.13.0-win64.exe   -> 404  (older name)
#   releases/download/v0.14.2/Tofu-Setup-...exe   -> 200  (tag pinned)
#
# The window is open RIGHT NOW: VERSION says 0.15.2 while the newest release is
# v0.14.2, so the next publish must pass through it — handing 404s to everyone
# who clicks in the following 15 minutes, i.e. exactly when a fresh release
# draws the most downloads.
#
# Shortening the TTL cannot fix this (any window > 0 has the same failure), so
# the invariant is structural: THE URL MUST BE PINNED TO THE SAME RELEASE THE
# FILENAME CAME FROM. GitHub already hands us that URL — every asset in the
# payload carries ``browser_download_url`` of the form
# ``/releases/download/<tag>/<name>`` — so the fix is to stop discarding it.
