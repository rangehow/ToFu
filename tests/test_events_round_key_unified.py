"""RENDER_CONTRACT Phase 3 — roundNum unification guard (L7 drift).

TESTS-FIRST: RED on HEAD by design.

The stream-event contract in ``lib/agent_core/events.py`` labels a round index
with TWO different field names depending on the event family:

  * ``roundNum`` — TOOL_START / TOOL_PROGRESS / TOOL_RESULT / TOOL_DONE /
    CONTEXT_COMPACTED / timer-poll.
  * ``round``    — PHASE / DELTA_RESET / ROUND_USAGE / ROUND_COMMITTED /
    MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT / peer_inbox_inject / user_steer_inject.

The client then re-derives the index locally in every handler (and a tool round
is located by FOUR names: roundNum / round / llmRound / synthetic 9000000+len),
with NO single normalization point. Phase 3 unifies the wire contract to ONE
key (``roundNum``) so the reducer's ``locateRound`` has a single field to read.

This guard scans the EventSpec ``fields=`` dicts and asserts no round-bearing
spec still advertises a bare ``round`` key. RED now (the drift is real); GREEN
after §5 of docs/RENDER_CONTRACT_PHASE3_PLAN.md renames them to ``roundNum``.

  NEUTER (in-test): re-introducing a ``round`` field into the scanned set must
  re-flag → proves the scan is load-bearing, not vacuously green.

Pure static AST/text scan — no DB, no server. Standalone + pytest.
