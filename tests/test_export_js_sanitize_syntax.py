"""Regression test for the sanitizer-induced invalid-JS class.

Background — the `your-provider` unquoted-key bug (distinct from the
corrupt-source / merge-conflict class guarded by
tests/test_bundle_corruption_guard.py):

  export.py's opensource sanitizer did a blind
  ``content.replace('meituan', 'your-provider')`` on every non-brand-asset
  file. Brand registries like ``static/js/settings/branding.js`` and
  ``static/js/settings/visibility_defaults.js`` carry ``meituan`` as an
  UNQUOTED object key (``meituan: '<svg…>'`` / ``meituan:'Meituan'``). The
  rewrite turned it into ``your-provider:`` which JS parses as subtraction
  (``your - provider``) → "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token '-'",
  white-screening the whole exported app at
  ``bundle-XXXXXXXX.js:NNNNN``.

  The `_is_brand_asset` filename allowlist (settings.js / main.js / .css)
  did NOT cover these files — the settings.js monolith split (2026-05-28)
  orphaned the brand registries into settings/*.js and drifted the list.

Fix (two layers, both exercised here):
  1. Class fix — the replacement token is now a valid JS identifier
     (``yourprovider``), so it's a safe bareword key wherever ``meituan``
     was, file-agnostically.
  2. Safety net — export.py::_verify_exported_js_syntax runs ``node --check``
     over every exported .js and FAILS the export loudly on invalid JS.

These tests run the REAL sanitize transform over the REAL repo JS files and
assert the output parses with ``node --check``. skipif-node-absent; no DB.

    key must sanitize to valid JS. Catches a file the settings.js split (or a
    future refactor) newly orphaned from any exclusion.

    TWO THINGS THIS USED TO GET WRONG (both fixed 2026-07-31, pt_715f5283):

    1. **The pattern was anchored to the start of a line** (``^\\s*meituan\\s*:``
       with re.MULTILINE), so it could only see a key that opens its own line.
       It therefore could NOT see ``static/js/core/model_group.js:54``, which
       packs the brand map several keys to a line::

           mistral: 'Mistral', glm: 'GLM', meituan: 'Meituan', kimi: 'Kimi',

       That is the exact shape this guard exists to catch — an unquoted bareword
       key the sanitizer rewrites — and formatting decided whether the guard
       could see it. A guard whose coverage depends on where a comma fell is
       not covering the class.

    2. **The floor was a hard-coded count** (``swept >= 2``) naming two specific
       files. ``visibility_defaults.js`` legitimately stopped carrying the key
       (the 0d3293da brand-grouping refactor), so the guard went red for a
       SOURCE IMPROVEMENT while the class invariant still held perfectly. A
       count floor pinned to a file layout produces a false red on every move.

    The property being guarded has nothing to do with how many files there are:
    *whatever* set of files carries the key, every one of them must sanitize to
    parseable JS. So the set is DISCOVERED and each member asserted; the only
    count assertion left is liveness (see below), which is about the guard not
    silently becoming a no-op.
