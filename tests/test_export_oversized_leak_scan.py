"""Regression guard: the opensource-export secret scan must NOT skip a leak
that lives in a text file LARGER than rg's ``--max-filesize`` cap.

Background — the oversized-file leak class:

  ``_rg_files_with_matches`` (and the verify scan) drive the opensource
  sanitize/verify passes with ``rg --max-filesize 5M``. rg SILENTLY SKIPS any
  file above that size, so a >5 MB text file carrying an API key / internal
  hostname / ``/mnt/...`` path never entered the sanitize candidate set and
  was tar-copied to the public mirror VERBATIM — and the verify scan (also
  5M-capped) wouldn't even flag it.

Root-cause fix: ``_scan_oversized_text_files`` supplements the rg hit set by
scanning, in-process, every text file strictly ABOVE the cap; the verify pass
gained the same supplement. So an oversized leak is now sanitized (and, if it
somehow survives, flagged by verify) instead of shipped.

Internal tokens here are assembled from fragments (never a contiguous literal)
because this guard file is itself shipped in the exported tree — a raw literal
would reintroduce the very leak it guards against. See
tests/test_export_conf_path_sanitize.py's docstring.

Runs the REAL scan over a synthetic temp tree; no DB, no network.
