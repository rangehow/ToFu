"""Guards for ``lib.file_history.detect_external_edits``.

Regression suite for the two defects the external-edit probe had (both
confirmed against live store data before the fix):

  1. PHANTOM FIRES — the probe compared only mtime/size, and a Tofu write
     tool leaves a ``mtime: 0`` sentinel in ``tracked.json`` (see
     ``store._stage_explicit``).  Every subsequent probe then saw
     ``real_mtime != 0`` and staged a redundant, byte-identical backup +
     fired a false ``project_external_edit`` toast — even though nothing
     changed on disk out-of-band.  Observed live: five byte-identical
     backup blobs and 750 external snapshots on one root.

  2. MISATTRIBUTION — the store is shared across every conversation on a
     project root.  A concurrent Tofu conversation's write drifted the
     file relative to *this* task's round boundary, and the probe reported
     it as an "edited outside Tofu (IDE)" edit.  The tracked entry already
     carries ``last_writer_task_id``; a drift attributed to a known Tofu
     task is a sibling conversation, not an IDE edit.

Each guard has a NEUTER control proving it is load-bearing: disable the
guard and the false positive returns.
