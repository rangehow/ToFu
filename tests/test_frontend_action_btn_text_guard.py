"""General guard for the icon-only ``.action-btn`` square.

WHY (supersedes tests/test_frontend_orphan_resume_btn_class.py)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The orphan-resume affordance was the concrete instance of a general bug class:
a TEXT-bearing button was emitted as ``<button class="orphan-resume-btn
action-btn">…</button>``. ``.action-btn`` (static/styles.css) is the project's
fixed-size ICON-ONLY square — ``width:32px;height:32px``, no padding — so under
the global ``box-sizing:border-box`` the square won over the size-less text
class and squashed the button into a tiny box (the CJK label wrapped one glyph
per line, the icon overflowed).

The orphan-resume button itself is GONE now (the capability was replaced by
automatic self-heal in core/health_stream_timer.js), so the old single-selector
guard rotted to zero hits. But the INVARIANT it taught us is still real and
still worth guarding, and it is bigger than one button:

    a button that carries visible text must NOT wear the bare ``.action-btn``
    square — text needs room, the square has none.

This guard is therefore GENERAL and scans every shipped JS file. It is resolved
by the bundle manifest (``lib/js_bundler._BUNDLE_FILES + _DEFERRED_FILES``) —
the single source of truth for what actually reaches a user — NOT by a
hardcoded file path, so it survives the next module split and never scans code
that no user can reach.

What counts as a violation
--------------------------
A ``<button>`` whose class list contains the bare token ``action-btn`` AND
whose inner content carries visible text (after stripping ``<svg>`` / ``<i>``
icons, ``Icon(...)`` interpolations and HTML entities) AND whose opening tag
does NOT inline-override the square (``width:auto`` / ``height:auto``). The
inline override is the legitimate escape hatch the codebase already uses for
text+icon action buttons (e.g. the welcome-screen Retry / New Chat buttons),
so those are NOT flagged.

NEGATIVE CONTROL: ``test_nc_text_button_with_bare_action_btn_goes_red`` builds
a source with exactly the original orphan-resume shape (text button, bare
``action-btn``, no override) and asserts the detector flags it — proving the
guard has teeth. The shipped tree is untouched.

Pure source-level (no node/jsdom needed).
