"""Frontend boot first-open seamlessness (ChatGPT-parity).

A returning user must land DIRECTLY in a conversation the moment the page opens
— not stare at the "New Chat" welcome screen for the whole server round-trip on
a slow / flaky tunnel, then watch it snap to their conversation.

Guarded here as SOURCE INVARIANTS (no jsdom — matches the repo's node-free
source-assertion convention for boot wiring the e2e harness can't exercise):

  1. main.js — right after `hydrateSidebarFromCache()` resolves (cache-first
     sidebar paint, BEFORE the server round-trip), boot opens a conversation
     via `loadConversation(...)`:
       • the SPECIFIC last-active conv when its id is known AND in the cache
         (in-tab reload, or a cold open whose localStorage mirror resolves);
       • else, on a COLD open with NO known id, the MOST-RECENT cached conv
         (`conversations[0]` — hydrate sorts recency-first via _convSorter);
       • gated on `!activeConvId` (never yank a user who already navigated).

  2. Durable restore id — sessionStorage is per-tab and dies on a browser
     close, so `_restoredConvId` also falls back to a localStorage mirror
     (`tofu_lastActiveConvId`) written on every leave (visibilitychange→hidden /
     pagehide). This is what makes a genuine COLD open restore the SPECIFIC
     last conversation, matching ChatGPT.

  3. main_init_tasks.js — `_ensureNewest()` must NOT repaint over an in-flight
     first-open skeleton (`_initialSwitchLoad` + `_needsLoad` + empty messages),
     which would flash the generic "Loading conversation…" welcome over it.
