"""Chat-container smooth-scroll drift guard.

BACKGROUND (2026-07-24 fix)
---------------------------
The tofu theme (the DEFAULT theme) used to set
    [data-theme="tofu"] .chat-container { scroll-behavior:smooth }
which turned the every-rAF `scrollTop = scrollHeight` write in
`scrollToBottom()` into an animation. During streaming, scrollHeight is still
growing, so the smooth animator perpetually chases a moving target — visible
as the reader drifting off the bottom then snapping back ("generation makes
the page scroll up and down on its own"). Compounded by
`#chatContainer{overflow-anchor:auto}`, which briefly pins content above the
viewport and fights the "stick to bottom" write.

The fix flipped the rule to `scroll-behavior:auto`. This test is the drift
guard: any sibling that later adds `scroll-behavior:smooth` on the
chat-container selectors under ANY theme block (dark/light/tofu/any new
`[data-theme="…"]`, or the unthemed base) fails here — because a memory-only
warning is only visible in sessions where memory is enabled AND prefetch
happens to surface it, whereas the test is a hard collect-gate signal every
sibling sees.

INVARIANT
---------
No CSS rule whose selector list references any of
    `.chat-container`, `#chatContainer`, `#chatInner`
may include `scroll-behavior: smooth` in its declaration block. Absence or
`scroll-behavior: auto` is fine.

Per-call `scrollIntoView({behavior:'smooth'})` from JS is a per-invocation
option and is NOT inherited from a container's `scroll-behavior` CSS rule, so
that smoothed jump-to-target behavior (branch panel, turn nav) is unaffected.
Rules on OTHER scrollables (e.g. `.paper-qa-messages`, `.branch-messages`)
are unrelated and legal.

PARSING
-------
The test parses CSS BLOCKS, not raw substrings. This is load-bearing: the
fix-side comment above the corrected rule contains the word `smooth` several
times, and a naive `substring "smooth"` search would false-positive on it.
Comments are stripped first; then leaf `{ ... }` blocks are enumerated with
their preceding selector text; a match on our selectors is combined with a
declaration-level `scroll-behavior:` lookup.

MANUAL NEUTER-PROOF (run once at authoring; not automated)
----------------------------------------------------------
Temporarily edit static/styles.css from `scroll-behavior:auto` back to
`scroll-behavior:smooth` on the `[data-theme="tofu"] .chat-container` rule
(styles.css ~L12748). Run:
    PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1 python -m pytest -q \
        tests/test_frontend_chat_container_no_smooth_scroll.py
The `test_no_smooth_scroll_on_chat_container_selectors` test MUST fail. Restore
and confirm the whole file goes green again. Result recorded in JOURNAL.md.

    Load-bearing for this test: the fix-side commentary above the target rule

    is unambiguous.

    Delegates to the SINGLE shared implementation (charter #24).

    EQUIVALENCE, MEASURED on the real 22k-line static/styles.css rather than
    assumed: the local ``re.sub(r'/\*.*?\*/', '', css, flags=re.DOTALL)`` this
    replaced and ``strip_comments(lang='css', inline=True)`` produce an
    IDENTICAL selector set (6466 rules, 0 selectors unique to either side) and
    a byte-identical whitespace-stripped content signature. They differ only in
    LINE NUMBERING -- the shared one blanks comment lines to preserve line
    count, the local one deleted them (20295 vs 22400 lines) -- which leaves 25
    rule bodies differing in whitespace alone. Every assertion here is
    whitespace-insensitive (substring / regex on a rule body), so the swap is
    behaviour-preserving; the suite is the proof.

    Keeping N copies of "what counts as a comment" is what let a fix land in one
    copy and not its duplicate -- incident 3 in the shared module's docstring.
