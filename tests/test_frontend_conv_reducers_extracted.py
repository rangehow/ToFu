"""Wire-parity for pt_3879f00e sub-part 2 — core/conversations.js decompose.

Scope: pull the 5 pure reducers at the top of core/conversations.js
(convAutoTranslate / assistantTailIsPriorTurn /
pollWriteWouldClobberSettledTail / convTitleById /
convAutoTranslateEffective) — ~166 lines of stateless helpers — into a
new leaf module ``static/js/core/conv_reducers.js`` so:

  (1) conversations.js shrinks by ~166 lines (2461 → ~2295), attacking
      the 134 KB core-bundle heavyweight the Epic-E dispatch names.
  (2) The reducers become independently discoverable / testable, and
      any future test can eval-load THIS one file (not the whole
      2461-line monolith with its Api / conversations / autoTranslate
      globals) to unit-test them.
  (3) The bundle order guarantees the leaf loads BEFORE conversations.js
      so its downstream consumers still resolve the bare names at
      runtime.

Failing-first: asserts (RED before extraction, GREEN after):

  1. ``static/js/core/conv_reducers.js`` exists and declares all 5
     reducers (via ``function convAutoTranslate`` etc.), and exposes
     them on ``window.*``.
  2. ``static/js/core/conversations.js`` NO LONGER declares those 5
     reducers (search for ``function convAutoTranslate(`` etc. — the
     definition site, not comment references).
  3. ``lib/js_bundler.py::_BUNDLE_FILES`` lists
     ``core/conv_reducers.js`` BEFORE ``core/conversations.js`` so the
     concatenated bundle preserves the load order (any consumer
     inside conversations.js that reads a reducer at IIFE time —
     currently none, but this locks future edits).
