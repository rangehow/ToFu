"""Regression guard for pt_3879f00e sub-part 3 — cross_tab_sync deferability.

Companion to test_frontend_health_stream_timer_deferrable.py. This locks the
"Option A" relocation the audit documented in docs/EPIC_E_DEFER_AUDIT.md:
move the ``_syncChannel = new BroadcastChannel(...)`` creation + its
``onmessage = _handleCrossTabMsg`` listener registration OUT of ``core.js``
(where it hard-refers ``_handleCrossTabMsg`` at module load) and INTO
``core/cross_tab_sync.js`` itself.

**Why this matters for deferability**: ``core/cross_tab_sync.js`` is 53KB.
The audit flagged it as a candidate for ``_DEFERRED_FILES``, blocked by the
fact that ``core.js:132`` had ``_handleCrossTabMsg(e.data)`` inside the
BroadcastChannel callback — if the module is deferred, that symbol is
undefined at boot and the first cross-tab message throws ReferenceError.

**The relocation**: after this commit, ``_handleCrossTabMsg`` is only
referenced inside the module that defines it — so deferring the module
means simply "no cross-tab sync until the module lands", not
"ReferenceError at boot". This is the exact same self-containment pattern
the health_stream_timer strangler sweep achieved with typeof-gates.

**Contract enforced**:

  1. ``core.js`` MUST NOT reference ``_handleCrossTabMsg`` anywhere
     (module load or callback body). The old ``_syncChannel.onmessage =
     (e) => _handleCrossTabMsg(...)`` block is GONE.
  2. ``core/cross_tab_sync.js`` MUST create ``_syncChannel`` and register
     its ``onmessage`` handler — the audit's "Option A" move.
  3. ``TAB_ID`` (needed by cross_tab_sync's postMessage AND by main.js's
     boot log line) STAYS in ``core.js`` — it's a leaf constant with
     multiple consumers.
  4. ``_syncChannel`` MUST remain window-scoped (both files can read it
     with a bare identifier) — accessed via ``if (!_syncChannel)`` in
     cross_tab_sync.js's ``_broadcastToTabs``.
