"""Regression: `initActiveTasks` must load folders even when a SIBLING boot
fetch rejects.

WHY
---
Folder loading (`loadFolders`) used to be a third leg of a shared
``Promise.all`` in ``initActiveTasks``::

    const [, , activeResp] = await Promise.all([
      loadConversationsFromServer(prefetchTarget),
      loadFolders(),
      Api.chat.activeResponse(),
    ]);

``Promise.all`` short-circuits on the FIRST sibling rejection and discards the
other legs, then control jumps to the outer ``catch``. So a transient failure
in ``loadConversationsFromServer`` / ``Api.chat.activeResponse`` would skip
folder loading entirely — leaving ``_folders`` empty even though folders exist
server-side (the folder rail vanishes; only the "+ New folder" quick-add shows).
``loadFolders`` owns a bounded-backoff self-heal (``_scheduleFolderLoadRetry``)
but it only fires from ``loadFolders``' OWN catch, which never ran when a sibling
sank the shared ``Promise.all`` first.

THE FIX
-------
``loadFolders`` is DECOUPLED from the conversation/active-task ``Promise.all``:
kicked off in parallel (no perf loss) but with its own ``.catch`` that fires the
self-heal retry, and ``_migratePinnedToFolder`` chained after folders resolve.

This test drives the REAL shipped ``initActiveTasks`` under node with
``Api.chat.activeResponse`` REJECTING, and asserts ``loadFolders`` still ran.
DOUBLE-NEUTER: re-couple folders back into the ``Promise.all`` in a COPY and
prove ``loadFolders`` then does NOT run — i.e. the test discriminates the fix.

Runs the REAL shipped JS under node; skips cleanly when node isn't installed.
