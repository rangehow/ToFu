"""Regression guard for pt_3879f00e sub-part 3: every consumer of
``core/health_stream_timer.js``'s ``twStart`` / ``twUpdate`` / ``twStop``
functions MUST typeof-gate the call, so the module can be moved into
``_DEFERRED_FILES`` without tripping ``ReferenceError`` on the first SSE
frame after boot.

The audit in ``docs/EPIC_E_DEFER_AUDIT.md`` enumerated ~40 unguarded call
sites across 8 files as the sole deferrability blocker. This test locks
the invariant: any new ``twUpdate(convId)`` bare-statement call added
after this test lands will trip it, forcing the author to add the
``if (typeof twUpdate === 'function')`` gate (the pattern used everywhere
else already).

The pattern this test forbids is a bare STATEMENT of the form
``<indent>tw{Start,Update,Stop}(<args>);\n`` at line start. It does NOT
forbid the guarded form ``if (typeof twX === 'function') twX(...)`` — that's
the whole point. It also does NOT touch inline usages inside an expression
(e.g. ``foo(twStop)`` is not a statement); those are inert without a call.

Files scanned: every ``static/js/**/*.js`` file that is currently in the
core bundle (``_BUNDLE_FILES``) OR streaming-adjacent (ui/ subdir). We
scan them all rather than a fixed allowlist so a future file added to the
core bundle can't reintroduce the pattern silently.
