"""tests/test_frontend_no_client_timeouts.py — the browser half of "no timeouts".

WHY
---
The transport-level read/first-byte timeouts were removed from the backend
(lib/llm/_transport.py, commit 1db38585) on the owner's rule: "unless it
crashes, what is there that can't be waited for? If I can't wait, I will
naturally pause it myself."

That is only half the objective. "I will pause it myself" happens IN THE
BROWSER, and the browser had its own ceilings that fired without the user
ever pressing anything:

  1. ``branch_stream.js`` aborted a branch SSE stream after 45s with no first
     byte — a client-side re-implementation of the exact TTFT kill just
     deleted from the transport, and 4x more aggressive than the 180s it
     replaced. The server kept generating (and billing); the browser had
     already dropped to the poll fallback.
  2. ``api.js`` applied a blanket 30000ms ceiling to every request that did
     not opt out. The backend's ``chat(timeout=120)`` and the dispatch total
     budget were deleted, and this silently re-imposed a *stricter* one —
     surfaced to the user as ``code:'timeout'``, i.e. "it died", when it had
     not. That the default was backwards is measurable: 22 call sites had to
     write ``timeout: 0`` to be allowed to wait.
  3. ``image-gen.js`` aborted generation at 150s and labelled it "timed out",
     discarding an image the server was still rendering.

THE RULE (same on both sides of the wire)
-----------------------------------------
**A liveness PROBE may bound itself. A WAIT may not.**

Probes keep their explicit budgets (health.check 3s/5s, backend_offline_monitor,
cross_tab_sync 8s/15s) — they answer "is the server there?", and an unbounded
probe is a hung UI. Anything that waits for the model to produce work is
unbounded, and ends when the user says so.

The last test is the durable one: a source scan (comment-stripped via
tests/_source_scan.strip_comments, charter #24) that fails when a NEW
abort-timer appears on a generation path, so the rule survives the next person
who reaches for setTimeout(...abort).
