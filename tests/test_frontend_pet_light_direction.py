"""The pet's facing must agree with its travel, and its walk must read as a walk.

THE REPORT THIS SUITE NOW GUARDS (2026-07-30)
─────────────────────────────────────────────
"the pet walks backward — facing left while moving right". The previous art was
an ISOMETRIC cube whose three faces baked a sun in; mirroring the whole sprite
would teleport that sun, so the flip had been confined to a character-space
subgroup (face+feet turned, body never did). That kept the light consistent —
and froze the body's 3/4 orientation: half the time the cube's depth face
pointed against the direction of travel. One-sun consistency and facing
consistency are STRUCTURALLY mutually exclusive for a 3/4 body, so the revamp
replaced the art with a FRONT-FACING AI-designed character (soft symmetric
shading, no baked sun). With nothing to keep in world space, the WHOLE frame
mirrors on the <img> elements and body + gaze + stride always agree with
travel. The scene-sun coupling survives where it is art-independent: the
::after cast shadow + the CSS filter form light.

Older defects this file guarded, and where they now stand:

1. LIGHT TELEPORTED ON TURN (2026-07-29) — moot: no baked sun, nothing to
   teleport. The form light is a CSS filter (drop-shadow/brightness), which
   follows the sprite's own alpha at any facing.
2. THE GAIT NEVER ALTERNATED (2026-07-29) — still guarded, now on the shipped
   PIXELS: the two contact beats must show a wide split with the pair shifted
   between beats, and the passing beats must gather.
3. THE CYCLE RAN AT 6.7fps (2026-07-29) — still guarded: 8 slots at 75ms.

No node, no browser here: CSS/JS source contracts (comments stripped per
charter #24) + PIL pixel proofs on the shipped PNGs.

#  4. THE CHARACTER IS THE SAME SIZE, IN THE SAME PLACE, IN EVERY FRAME
#
#  THE DEFECT THIS SECTION EXISTS FOR (measured 2026-07-31, previously
#  UNGUARDED — all 82 pet guards were green while it shipped):
#  process_ai_frames.py trimmed EACH frame to its own alpha bbox and scaled it
#  so ITS OWN longest side hit MAX_SIDE. The scale factor was therefore a
#  FUNCTION OF THE POSE (0.1837–0.2319, a 26% spread), which broke the
#  character three ways at once:
#    · SIZE WOBBLE — blush cheek-to-cheek span varied 16.5% across the frames
#      that share the character's stance, and 9.7% within walk1..4, i.e. the pet
#      breathed a tenth of its own width 13 times a second while walking. This
#      is what "glitching out" looked like. (Population matters: over all 22
#      frames the figure was 73.8% before / 50.0% after, but scratch1/scratch2
#      are deliberate stretch/squash extremes whose size SHOULD differ — they
#      are excluded from the stance set below for exactly that reason, and
#      test_the_pipeline_scales_every_frame_by_the_SAME_factor covers all 22
#      with the criterion that actually applies to them.)
#    · LATERAL TELEPORT — re-centring on the INK bbox let asymmetric FX
#      (thinking bubble, sparkles) shove the BODY sideways by up to 2.27px on a
#      30px sprite: an 8%-of-width jump fired by a MOOD change, nothing moving.
#    · FX PAID FOR THEMSELVES IN BODY SIZE — a pose with bigger sparkles got
#      scaled down, shrinking the body to make room for them.
#  The masters were innocent (walk body width varies 1.2% in the raws vs 6.4%
#  shipped), so the fix was one global scale + a body-centre/foot-line anchor.
#  These guards assert the RESULT on the shipped pixels, so the defect cannot
#  return through any future edit to the pipeline.
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# The character's rigid features must not change size between poses BEYOND what
# the drawings themselves vary. Two different tolerances, because they measure
# two different things:
#   · _SCALE_FIDELITY_PX — how far a shipped frame may deviate from EXACT
#     global scaling of its master. This is the real anti-regression bound: the
#     old per-frame pipeline blew it by ~2px, and integer rounding costs ~0.15px.
#   · _RIGID_TOL_PX — the absolute spread allowed across same-stance poses. It
#     must accommodate the artist's own line-width variation (measured 0.74px:
#     the raw masters' body width spans 651..674 canvas px), which a faithful
#     pipeline is REQUIRED to preserve, not iron out.
# Asserting the artist drew every pose pixel-identically would be asserting
# something false, so the load-bearing guard is scale FIDELITY, not equality.
