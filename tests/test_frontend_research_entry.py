"""Auto-research must be startable from the Reading-Mode LANDING screen.

The capability (harvest → survey → ideate) shipped with ZERO frontend entry:
grepping `static/` for `produce_research` returned nothing, so the only way to
launch it was hoping the chat model chose to call the tool — which is also
search-gated, so it silently disappeared whenever a user turned web search off.

★ Why the LANDING screen and not a 7th paper tab (owner ruling):
every `.paper-tab-panel` is **paper-hash scoped** — `_switchPaperTab` dispatches
`_loadOrGenerateReport` / `_initVideoTab`, and the video tab even looks its job
up with `Api.paper.videoLookup(_paperHash)`. But a research DIRECTION is
pre-paper: there is no open paper when you start one. A tab would force the
user to first open an unrelated paper. The landing screen already hosts the
direction-shaped `describe → recommend` input, so that is where this belongs.

These are BEHAVIOUR guards driving the REAL shipped source under jsdom (never a
hand-copied reducer — charter: a harness copy silently keeps asserting the old
world). They assert what a user can DO:

  1. start a job with NO paper open,
  2. see progress that survives a re-render, from the SERVER clock,
  3. see a degraded job AS degraded (artifact_quality), not as success.

Skips cleanly when node/jsdom dev-deps are absent.
