"""Frontend test — the degraded-section contract (settings/section_requires.js).

THE DEFECT (found by the owner in the live UI, 2026-07-29): the "Brand mascot"
settings block shipped its heading + description as static server-spliced HTML,
while its tiles were painted by JS from core/brand_logo.js. A running server
holds the bundle manifest it booted with, so a NEWLY added module is absent
from the served bundle until a restart — and the user was shown a title, a
description, and an EMPTY BOX. A control that looks available and does nothing.

That block has since been REMOVED (the owner settled the mascot question: one
mascot, no picker), so the contract currently has NO shipped consumer. The
mechanism is kept because it is generic and the defect is a property of how
JS-painted settings blocks are built, not of that one picker — see the header
of section_requires.js.

Consequently these tests drive SYNTHETIC markup built to the documented
contract. That is deliberate and stated plainly: a guard that pointed at the
deleted logo block would either fail or, worse, be quietly rewritten to assert
something that no longer ships. When a real block adopts `data-requires`, add a
wiring guard for THAT block — `test_a_shipped_block_that_declares_the_contract_is_wired`
below is the ready-made anchor for it.
