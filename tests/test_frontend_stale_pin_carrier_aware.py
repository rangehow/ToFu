"""Carrier-aware stale-pin sweep — the defect d6e8bdb3 introduced.

WHAT WENT WRONG
---------------
d6e8bdb3 made a live autopilot VU carrier reachable on cold attach. Attaching
goes through ``_connectAutopilotKick``, which sets ``conv.activeTaskId =
<carrierId>`` — necessary, because ``connectToTask`` uses that pin as the
accumulation-slot anchor and as the self-heal handle.

But the 25s poll's stale-pin sweep (``_reconcileStuckActiveTaskPins``) builds
its liveness set from ``Api.chat.active()``, and ``/api/v1/chat/active``
deliberately EXCLUDES carriers (``routes/chat.py``, ``is_carrier_task``). That
exclusion is CORRECT for that endpoint's own contract — it answers "what may I
reconnect an SSE to?", and five callers feed its result to the PLAIN
``connectToTask`` path where a carrier births a permanently-stuck "Waiting…"
bubble.

So the sweep saw a pin naming a task that was absent from its running set and
judged it stale. Measured consequences:

  * the sweep calls ``_healStuckPlaceholder(convId, {background: true})`` with
    NO ``status``, so ``_cleanDone`` evaluates FALSE and the background branch
    stamps ``finishReason = 'interrupted'`` on unsettled trailing content —
    the user reads "已中断" while the backend VU turn is still running;
  * it clears ``conv.activeTaskId`` and writes ``conv._activeTaskClearedAt``,
    and ``conv_apply_settings.js`` treats that stamp as "NEVER restore
    activeTaskId from server metadata again".

That is the objective's own disease (showing the user a state that is not
true), introduced by the fix for it.

THE FIX THIS SUITE PINS
-----------------------
Give the sweep a SECOND liveness source: the conv-state projection that
``f80b0446`` already added, which DOES see carriers (``<tid>#vu``). Concretely
the sweep reads ``conv._authoritativeActiveTaskIds`` — the set the REAL reducer
derives from that projection, with markers already stripped — so there is no
second hand-rolled parse of the wire. A pin survives when EITHER source still
knows the task.

Ordering is load-bearing: ``applyConvStateSnapshot`` must run BEFORE the sweep,
or the sets it reads are from the previous tick.

Fail-safe posture is preserved and made explicit: the sweep touches NOTHING
unless BOTH probes succeeded. The pre-existing contract already said "never
clear on a probe failure"; a carrier is exactly the case where a missing second
probe means "I cannot prove this is stale".

WHY NOT put carriers on /api/chat/active
----------------------------------------
That is the tempting one-line change and it is wrong — it would reach five
consumers that feed the plain connectToTask path. ``test_chat_active_still_
excludes_carriers`` in the poll-lane suite is the complement guard for that.

ASSERTED HERE
-------------
  1. a pin naming a LIVE VU carrier is NOT cleared, the trailing turn is NOT
     stamped interrupted, and no ``_activeTaskClearedAt`` is written;
  2. a genuinely stale pin IS still cleared (the reverse defect — a sweep that
     never clears anything would re-open "the dot outlives the work");
  3. a live PLAIN worker is still left alone (unchanged behaviour);
  4. probe failure on EITHER source clears nothing (fail-safe);
  5. the snapshot is applied BEFORE the sweep in the shipped poll body.
