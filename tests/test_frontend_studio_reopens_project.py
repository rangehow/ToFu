"""Frontend test — the Studio dial must ALWAYS open the project panel.

Regression: when the standalone project launcher button was folded into the
Air/Pro/Studio capability dial, the Studio segment became the ONLY affordance
for attaching / managing a project. But `setChatMode('studio')` only called
`openProjectModal()` when NO project was attached — once a project was already
attached, clicking Studio again just re-selected the mode and returned. That
left a conv already in Studio with no way to CHANGE its project path (clicking
Studio repeatedly was a silent no-op).

The fix: the Studio segment always opens the project panel — waiting for a real
attach when none exists, and reopening the panel (path management) when one is
already attached. This test drives the REAL shipped `setChatMode` under node
and asserts the panel opens in BOTH states. A neuter that early-returns without
opening in the has-project branch must fail the has-project case.
