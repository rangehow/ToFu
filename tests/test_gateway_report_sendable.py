"""The outbound gateway report must contain nothing internal-only.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
The report at ``docs/GATEWAY_REPORT_CACHE_NOT_REUSED.md`` is written to be
FORWARDED to the `sankuai_anthropic` gateway team — people at another org.

Its review notes originally lived at the bottom of that same file under a
heading reading "REMOVE THIS SECTION BEFORE SENDING". That made correctness
depend on a human remembering to delete a section from a document they were in
the middle of forwarding, and the content was exactly what we would least want
to hand the other side:

  * our own enumeration of the argument's weak points,
  * the admission that the CNY column is an upper bound,
  * the admission that we lack the decisive second-path control,
  * internal ticket ids and tone-check instructions.

"Remember to delete this" is not a control. The notes now live in
``docs/internal/GATEWAY_REPORT_REVIEW_NOTES.md`` and this guard asserts they
cannot drift back — so the leak is structurally impossible rather than
procedurally avoided.

GUARDS
  * The sendable report exists and contains no internal-only marker.
  * The internal companion exists, is marked internal, and still carries the
    substance (so "fix the guard by deleting the notes" is not a way out).
  * COMPLEMENT: the sendable report still contains the things that make it
    worth sending — trace ids, the ruled-out table, the reproduce command.
