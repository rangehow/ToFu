"""DRIFT-GUARD: git-tracked files must not leak through the opensource export gate.

Why this exists
---------------
Tofu publishes via ``export.py`` (the opensource mode strips personal /
internal / not-part-of-the-product paths), and ``.gitignore`` is the SECOND
line of defense — it stops those same paths from being committed in the first
place. Historically the two lists were maintained by hand and DRIFTED: a path
was added to ``export.py``'s exclude sets but nobody added a matching
``.gitignore`` rule, so it sat *tracked* in the repo. Nothing broke while
publication went through export (it got stripped there), but the moment anyone
pushed the working repo directly to a public remote, it leaked
(``uploads/`` papers, ``overleaf_cache/`` unpublished theses, ``.tofu/skills``
personal notes, ``scripts/`` / ``benchmarks/`` with hardcoded internal paths…).

The root cause is exactly this drift. This guard closes it by asserting the
invariant DIRECTLY against the live git index + the live ``export.py`` rules,
so the two can never silently diverge again:

    Every git-tracked file MUST be shippable in an ``opensource`` export,
    except a small, explicitly documented allow-list of keepers.

Sibling of ``tests/test_runtime_layout.py::test_gitignore_covers_registry``,
which guards the *mutable-user-state* axis (data/ logs/ uploads/ … from the
``runtime_layout`` registry). That test's docstring deliberately scopes ITSELF
out of the "not part of the public product" axis (scripts/ benchmarks/ debug/
promo/ …). THIS test covers that second axis, keyed on ``export.py`` instead of
the runtime_layout registry — together they cover both.

Keepers (tracked on purpose, even though export excludes them)
--------------------------------------------------------------
A few files are export-excluded yet MUST stay tracked in the private repo:
  * ``export.py`` / ``CLAUDE.md`` — the export infra + agent-rules doc; excluded
    from the *published* tree but are real source in the working repo.
  * ``static/provider_templates/meituan.json`` — a functional internal provider
    template (export sanitizes/strips it for the public build).
  * ``export._OPENSOURCE_KEEP_FILES`` — files that live inside an
    opensource-excluded dir but the public build restores verbatim
    (e.g. ``scripts/gen_desktop_icons.py`` for CI icon generation).
Each keeper is a project-root-relative path and is the ONLY sanctioned way to
keep a tracked-but-export-excluded file: add it here + document why.

#
# WHY THEY MUST STAY TRACKED (the constraint that rules out `git rm --cached`):
# they are the pipeline's ONLY input. The 2026-07-31 size-constancy fix works by
# deriving ONE global scale + a shared body/foot anchor from measurements taken
# across ALL masters — so the invariant is only reproducible while they exist.
# Untrack them and the pipeline cannot be re-run from a clean clone: nobody can
# regenerate a frame, verify `--check`, or re-derive the scale, and the guards in
# tests/test_frontend_pet_light_direction.py lose their subject permanently
# rather than skipping in one tree.
#
# WHY THEY MUST NOT BE PUBLISHED: 5.7MB of review-only master art (export.py
# lists `_candidates` in ALWAYS_EXCLUDE_DIRS for exactly this reason). The public
# build ships the finished frames; it has no use for the raws.
#
# Both constraints hold at once, which is precisely what this keeper list is for.
# Registered as a PREFIX rather than 16 hand-copied paths: adding or re-rendering
# a pose must not require editing this file, and every path under the prefix
# carries the identical justification. The prefix is anchored to the one subtree
# (not a bare `_candidates` glob), so it cannot silently absorb an unrelated dir.
