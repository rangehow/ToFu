"""Guard: /api/health liveness is DECOUPLED from the DB probe (pt_afbaf3d7 ②).

/api/health is the frontend's offline ARBITER (backend_offline_monitor: two
failed probes → red "backend offline" banner). The old implementation ran
``SELECT 1`` inline, so a PG-on-FUSE stall (measured 4–7s Slow queries) pushed
the answer past the frontend's 3–4s probe budget and raised the banner on a
perfectly alive process.

INVARIANTS under test (each fails on the pre-fix inline implementation):
  1. The request path NEVER touches the DB inline — with a warm cache, a
     get_db/get_thread_db spy that raises on any call stays uncalled.
  2. A HUNG DB probe cannot push the health answer past the arbiter budget:
     cold start waits at most the bounded join (2s ≪ 3s), returns ok=True,
     and reports no db_responsive verdict yet.
  3. A cached FAILURE degrades db_responsive but never flips `ok` — process
     liveness and DB responsiveness are separate axes.
  4. A cached success is served straight from cache (fast path).

Pure-logic: the route function is called under a minimal Quart request
context; the DB layer is stubbed by monkeypatch. ``unit`` marker.
