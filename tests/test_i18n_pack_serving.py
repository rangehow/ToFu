"""Serving-level guards for the i18n single-language split (slice 2).

WHAT THIS PROVES, END TO END
----------------------------
Epic-E sub-part 1's final slice changes WHAT the server sends: the core
bundle excludes i18n.js, and the server injects a per-language pack tag in
its place. The failure modes are all invisible in production:

  * pack tag AFTER the bundle tag  → t() undefined at bundle exec (both are
    defer; document order decides). Boot breaks for EVERY user, no error
    that points at i18n.
  * bundle excludes i18n.js but no pack tag → the index.html stub
    ``t = key => key`` survives → the entire UI renders raw keys.
  * setLanguage switch with a broken merge → the boot language's entries
    vanish; half the UI flips to raw keys / fallback.
  * emission failure served as split → same as "no pack tag".

These tests drive the REAL serving path (flask_client → index_page) and the
REAL generated artifacts.

# ── The publish window (a lock-free reader must never see a torn manifest) ──

def test_publish_order_keeps_the_bundle_pointer_last(monkeypatch):
    """``_bundle_filename`` must be published AFTER its i18n pair.

    WHY THIS IS AN ORDER RATCHET AND NOT A BEHAVIOUR TEST. The accessors
    ``get_i18n_pack_tag`` / ``get_i18n_pack_urls`` read the manifest globals
    WITHOUT the build lock, and ``_schedule_background_rebuild()`` runs
    build_bundle() on a daemon thread concurrent with live request threads.
    Publishing the pointer first let a request thread pair the NEW bundle
    (dictionary excluded) with the STALE ``_bundle_includes_i18n = True``:
    the page then shipped neither the dictionary nor a pack, the index.html
    ``t = key => key`` stub survived, and the whole UI rendered raw i18n keys
    with no error.

    I tried FOUR times to catch that behaviourally and every version was
    VACUOUS — green against the buggy order. Recorded so nobody repeats them:
      1. A reader thread racing build_bundle() in a loop — the five
         assignments take microseconds inside a ~1.8s build; luck never hits
         the window.
      2. Sampling from ``_source_max_mtime()`` — in the buggy order that is
         the LAST statement of the publish, so the manifest is already
         coherent when it runs.
      3. Reading ``bool(B._pack_filenames)`` from inside the probe — once
         published, that global IS the probe object, so the read re-enters
         ``__bool__`` and recurses; build_bundle()'s fail-open
         ``except Exception`` swallowed the RecursionError and the probe
         recorded nothing.
      4. Probing at ``not pack_map`` — measured: a same-source rebuild is a
         NO-OP (identical content hash, so ``core_name`` equals the published
         name), hence there is no torn state to observe at all. Forcing a real
         content change would mean mutating tracked static/js sources from a
         test, which is worse than the ratchet.
    So this asserts the ORDER directly, which is legitimate for a ratchet
    (charter: ratchets may inspect implementation, anchored on a semantic
    unit). It is anchored on the ASSIGNMENT STATEMENTS via AST, not on line
    numbers or source text, so a reformat cannot make it lie.
