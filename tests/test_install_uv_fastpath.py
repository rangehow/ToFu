"""Guard tests: install.sh's uv fast path + clean conda fallback.

Background — the "install is too slow" optimization (2026-07):
  The historical bottleneck was the conda-forge solve (build a full env +
  resolve 40+ packages, minutes). Measured data showed `uv venv` + `uv pip
  install -r requirements.txt` installs the same stack from prebuilt
  manylinux wheels in ~1-2 min with ZERO from-source builds. So install.sh
  now defaults to a uv fast path and falls back to the (unchanged) conda
  path when it can't or shouldn't use uv.

  The compatibility FLOOR is that the conda fallback must always remain
  reachable — CentOS7 / old-glibc hosts (where PyMuPDF/Pillow ship no
  manylinux2014 wheel) must land on conda cleanly. These tests pin the
  branch structure by static analysis (no network, no uv, no conda, no
  server) so the fast path can never silently swallow the fallback.

def test_playwright_downloads_only_the_headless_shell():
    """Measured 2026-07-28: a default ``playwright install chromium`` fetches
    BOTH full Chromium (175.4 MB) AND chrome-headless-shell (113.2 MB) plus
    ffmpeg (2.3 MB) = 290.9 MB. ``--only-shell`` cuts the fetch to 115.5 MB
    (-60%), so this ratchet keeps every installer on the shell-only download.

    THE TRADE-OFF THIS RATCHET ENFORCES (read before widening or reverting it)
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    An earlier version of this docstring justified the flag with "zero
    ``headless=False`` / ``record_video`` / ``channel=`` call sites". That was
    measured FALSE on 2026-07-29 and is NOT why the flag is correct. The real
    picture:

      * There is EXACTLY ONE headed call site in the product:
        ``tofu_search/fetch/interactive_login.py`` (login-wall cookie capture,
        a rare, user-initiated action).
      * ``chrome-headless-shell`` has NO headed mode — it is a separate,
        smaller binary, not a flag on the full build. So on a shell-only
        install that ONE feature genuinely cannot work; measured, a headed
        launch fails with "Executable doesn't exist at
        .../chromium-<rev>/chrome-linux64/chrome".
      * Every OTHER browser path here (fetch, JS render, screenshots, the
        video render chain, the visual test ring) is headless and fully served
        by the shell.

    So the flag buys -60% download for all users at the cost of one rare
    feature — and that feature no longer DIES at launch: availability is
    decided by ``chromium_env.headed_chromium_executable()`` and the caller
    returns ``reason='headed_unavailable'`` naming the recovery command
    (``python -m playwright install chromium``). Guards for that live in
    tests/test_chromium_env.py.

    Evidence the shell is sufficient for the headless paths: the dev host
    carries ONLY ``chromium_headless_shell-1223`` (no ``chromium-*`` dir at
    all), ``chromium_env.chromium_binaries`` resolves it, ``chrome_bin`` in
    lib/motion_video/_env.py delegates to that resolver, and every screenshot
    path works including the real-browser visual ring.
