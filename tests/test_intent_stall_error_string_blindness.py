"""Criterion-A blindness to errors-returned-as-content (epic pt_5303eb3c7afb44a8).

THE SHAPE. ``_round_failed`` decides "did the previous tool round fail?" from
STRUCTURAL fields only — ``status``, per-result ``notRun`` / ``badge`` / ``type``
/ ``exitCode``. But a large family of project tools does not FAIL, it RETURNS a
failure: ``read_files`` with an inverted line range returns the string
``'Error: requested line range 6171-6162 is empty or out of bounds ...'`` as
ordinary content, and the round is finalized ``status='done'`` with a perfectly
normal ``badge='21961L'``. No structural field carries the failure, so criterion
A reads "previous tool was fine" and the intent-stall nudge is suppressed.

WHY THE FIX MUST NOT SNIFF THE PROSE (the trap this file pins). "content
contains 'Error:'" is NOT a usable criterion: ``read_files`` on a log file and
``grep_search`` matching lines that contain the word both return content full of
``Error:`` while having SUCCEEDED. A nudge fired on those would re-drive a model
that did nothing wrong, and the measurement (docs/INTENT_STALL_MEASUREMENT.md)
is explicit that a false positive costs more than a miss. ``run_command`` is the
sharpest case: a command may legitimately print ``Error: ...`` on stdout and
exit 0. So the failure must be STAMPED at the point the execution layer
generates it, and ``_round_failed`` must read that stamp.

GROUND TRUTH — conv ms5i5ydigs9j9w (2026-07-29 11:20:38–11:21:04, app.log):
    roundNum 35 / llmRound 25  read_files(start=6171, end=6162)  -> 'Error: ...'
