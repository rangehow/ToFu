"""The intent-stall nudge's USER-VISIBLE contract (epic pt_5303eb3c7afb44a8).

The nudge machinery has three surfaces that face a human or the wire, and each
one is a place where a MACHINE signal can leak into something a person reads or
a model replays:

1. **``[END_TURN: …]`` must never reach the delivered answer.** ``NUDGE_TEXT``
   *teaches* the token, so the moment the nudge can fire, models start emitting
   it. It is the classifier's input, not prose.
2. **The nudge row must never reach the wire.** The nudge is appended as a
   ``role='user'`` message with no human author. Rendering it as a chip is
   right; replaying it as if the user said it is not.
3. **The phase label must be translatable.** Every other retry bucket ships an
   i18n key; a hardcoded string would render Chinese to an English user.

Each test below asserts the RESULT (what a reader/model would receive), never
the shape of the implementation that produces it.
