"""tests/test_local_control_browser_probe.py — the extension-install guidance
must be driven by a real browser PROBE, not by ``remote_addr``.

WHAT THIS GUARDS
----------------
The "帮我打开扩展管理页" button was a dead button, and the three failures that
made it dead compounded into a single silent 404 (observed live: three
``POST /api/v1/browser/open-extensions → 404`` in ``logs/app.log``, each
logging "no Chrome-family browser found on this machine"):

  1. **Wrong machine.** ``subprocess.Popen`` opens a window on the SERVER.
     That only helps a user who is physically at the server. The gate for
     "is the user at the server" was ``_remote_is_loopback()`` — a pure IP
     test that, under the standard same-host reverse-proxy / tunnel
     deployment, reports ``127.0.0.1`` for *every public request* (the
     ProxyFix seam is not wired; see docs/UNIFIED_DEVICE_BRIDGE_DESIGN.md
     §3.2b, which calls this out as a defect written up as a feature). So
     the gate said "you are local" to a user who was three network hops
     away, and the button rendered for them.
  2. **No browser to open.** A headless server has no Chrome, so even a
     genuinely-local user got a 404 from a button that had already promised
     to act.
  3. **Chrome-only probe.** Edge is Chromium-family and runs this very
     extension unchanged, but the probe never looked for it.

THE INVARIANT PINNED HERE
-------------------------
**A control that cannot achieve what it claims must not invite the click.**
``static/js/local-control.js`` states this rule in its own header and
enforces it for the two capability switches; this route's button was the one
place that broke it. So the fix is not a nicer failure message — the button
must NOT EXIST when the probe cannot find a browser to drive.

And the probe is the RIGHT criterion, strictly stronger than the IP test: if
this machine has no browser at all, then nobody is looking at this UI *from*
this machine, which also makes the server-side ``extensionPath`` useless.
Both therefore hang off the probe.

DISCIPLINE
----------
These are BEHAVIOUR guards. They assert what a caller observes — the JSON a
real request returns, the DOM a real render produces — never that some
private helper exists or that a line of source looks a certain way. The
frontend halves splice the renderer out of the SHIPPED file and run it under
jsdom, so the guard cannot drift into asserting a world production left
behind.
