"""tests/test_log_pytest_sink_isolation.py — 2026-07-13, REPOINTED 2026-07-27.

Regression guard: the test suite must never write into the PRODUCTION logs.

WHY (unchanged since 2026-07-13): ``tests/conftest.py`` does ``import server``
at collection time, which runs ``logging.basicConfig(handlers=[...])`` and
attaches the rotating FILE handlers (app.log / error.log / vendor.log /
access.log) to the ROOT logger for the whole session. The suite deliberately
drives error paths with mocked exceptions ('llm down', 'disk full', 'reload
boom', a merge-conflict 'bad.js'). Without isolation every test's
``logger.error()`` bleeds those fixtures into the REAL ``logs/error.log`` and
``logs/app.log`` — poisoning the operator's #1 diagnostic surface, because a
reader cannot tell a fixture from a real outage.

★ WHY THIS FILE WAS REWRITTEN (2026-07-27)

The original guard asserted a SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATION: ``server._UNDER_PYTEST``
and ``server._FILE_LOG_DIR == <repo>/logs/pytest``. Both symbols are GONE from
server.py — no ``git log -S`` hit, so they vanished in a wholesale rewrite of
the logging block rather than a traceable deletion. The guard had therefore
been RED for ~14 days, and with it dead the leak came back: measured
2026-07-27, one test emitting a single ``logger.error()`` + ``audit_log()``
grew the production ``app.log`` by 83 bytes and landed markers in BOTH
``app.log`` and ``audit.log``. Meanwhile that same app.log reached 9.1 GB in a
day (96% of it one wedged sub-agent), with test noise mixed in.

The replacement isolation is UPSTREAM of the handlers: ``tests/conftest.py``
sets ``TOFU_DATA_DIR`` to a per-worker temp dir BEFORE ``import server``, so
``lib/log.py`` resolves ``LOG_DIR`` (frozen at import time) into that temp dir
and EVERY consumer follows — the four file handlers, ``audit_log()``'s own
``AUDIT_LOG_FILE`` path, and anything else derived from the base dir. That is
strictly broader than the old ``logs/pytest/`` sink, which redirected only the
four handlers and still wrote inside the repo.

So these tests now assert the OUTCOME (nothing lands in <repo>/logs) rather
than the mechanism, which is what a guard should have pinned in the first
place — an implementation-shaped assertion is exactly what let this one rot
into a false red while the real protection silently disappeared.

Companion: tests/test_log_isolation_guard.py (path + write-through checks on
the lib.log constants). This file covers the server.py handler objects.
