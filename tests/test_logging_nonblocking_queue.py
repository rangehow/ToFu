"""Proves the production logging path is NON-BLOCKING under a log storm.

Root cause guarded: in production, WARNING/ERROR from every thread funnels
through file handlers whose ``error.log`` lives on a FUSE/NFS mount. Those
handlers do SYNCHRONOUS I/O under a per-handler lock, so a storm (a total
upstream 502 outage emitting thousands of lines) serializes EVERY logging
thread behind slow network writes — including the sync threads serving
``GET /`` and the health/conversation endpoints. That turns any log storm into
a dead frontend ("backend alive, frontend can't be served").

Fix (server.py): the root logger gets a single ``QueueHandler`` whose
``emit()`` is a non-blocking ``SimpleQueue.put()``; a background
``QueueListener`` thread drains the queue and does the actual slow I/O. A
logging caller therefore returns in microseconds regardless of how slow /
backed-up the sinks are.

This suite reconstructs the EXACT production wiring (QueueHandler +
QueueListener over a deliberately SLOW handler) and asserts:

  1. A logging caller returns immediately even when the underlying handler
     sleeps per record — i.e. the caller is decoupled from sink latency.
  2. Compared against attaching the same slow handler DIRECTLY (the old
     synchronous config), the queued caller is dramatically faster — the
     load-bearing behaviour. (NEUTER: swap the queue for the direct handler
     and the same assertion FAILS, proving the queue is what carries it.)
  3. No records are lost — after draining, every emitted record reached the
     sink (unbounded SimpleQueue never drops).
  4. Levels/filters and exc_info tracebacks survive the queue round-trip.
