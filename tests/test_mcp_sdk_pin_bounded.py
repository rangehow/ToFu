"""tests/test_mcp_sdk_pin_bounded.py — every MCP SDK dependency spec is bounded.

WHY THIS GUARD EXISTS (measured, 2026-07-29)
--------------------------------------------
The MCP Python SDK shipped **2.0.0** on 2026-07-28, the same day as the
``2026-07-28`` protocol revision. It is a breaking rework of the library, and
every declaration in this repo said ``mcp>=1.0`` with NO upper bound. Measured
consequences, verified against the real 2.0.0 wheel:

  * ``mcp.client.streamable_http.streamablehttp_client`` was RENAMED to
    ``streamable_http_client`` — ``lib/mcp/client/_bridge.py`` imports the old
    name, so a v2 resolve is an **ImportError** at first remote connect.
  * The transport yields ``(read_stream, write_stream)``; ``_bridge.py`` unpacks
    THREE values (``GetSessionIdCallback`` is gone) — **ValueError**.
  * Model fields moved to snake_case (``isError`` → ``is_error``,
    ``inputSchema`` → ``input_schema``, ``serverInfo`` → ``server_info``).
  * The low-level ``Server`` decorator API (``@server.list_tools()`` /
    ``@server.call_tool()``) was replaced by ``on_list_tools=`` /
    ``on_call_tool=`` constructor parameters, with NO ``__getattr__`` fallback
    — every vendored server under ``tools/`` registers via the decorators.

The pin sites are NOT one file. They span three install layers, and the most
dangerous one had no guard at all:

  1. ``requirements.txt``        — the normal install path.
  2. ``bootstrap.py``            — ``_CONDA_DEPS``, the PRE-BOOT installer. An
     unbounded spec here installs the breaking 2.x into Tofu's own interpreter
     *before the app starts*. ``test_bootstrap_conda_deps_coverage.py`` only
     asserted PRESENCE of ``_CRITICAL_BOOT_PACKAGES``, so this site was
     invisible to every existing guard.
  3. ``tools/*/pyproject.toml``  — vendored servers, pip-installed into TOFU'S
     OWN interpreter by ``lib/mcp/client/_install.py``. An unbounded spec here
     upgrades the SDK out from under the Tofu client.

  4. The SIBLING dev checkouts (``../hope-mcp``, ``../llm-mcp``, …) that
     ``tools/`` is vendored FROM. ``/tools/`` is gitignored, so the snapshots
     are not tracked here and re-running ``make vendor-mcp`` overwrites them
     from the sibling — fixing only the snapshot is therefore temporary. This
     guard can only see what is inside THIS repo, so the sibling pins are
     fixed at their source and the staleness detector in
     ``lib/mcp/client/_vendor.py`` reports snapshot drift.

WHY IT SCANS BY RESOURCE RATHER THAN A HARD-CODED FILE LIST
------------------------------------------------------------
``tools/*/pyproject.toml`` is GLOBBED, not enumerated. A hard-coded list is a
second copy of "which servers exist" that drifts the moment someone vendors a
new server — and the new server would inherit exactly the unbounded spec this
guard exists to forbid, while the guard stayed green. Discovery is the point.

Comments are stripped first via ``tests/_source_scan.strip_comments`` (charter
#24): this very file's prose contains the string ``mcp>=1.0`` as an example of
the FORBIDDEN shape, and a naive scanner would either flag the documentation or
be satisfied by it. Both directions are failures.

    WHY THIS IS A DIFFERENT DEFECT CLASS FROM THE UPPER BOUND ABOVE
    ---------------------------------------------------------------
    Bounding ``mcp`` protects ONE package that we happen to know broke. It does
    nothing for the other ~30 packages in a server's tree. Measured 2026-07-31
    against the real ``data/mcp-cache`` on this host: the FROZEN spec
    ``uvx --from 'overleaf-mcp-plus[compile]>=0.1.3'`` had materialised FIVE
    different ``mcp`` versions across 30 environments —

        1.28.1 ×16   1.28.0 ×5   1.27.2 ×5   2.0.0 ×3   1.29.0 ×1

    — while the server's own version was 0.2.1 in every single one. So 100% of
    the drift was TRANSITIVE, and neither pinning the launcher spec nor
    isolating the environment can fix it: each cold resolve is an independent
    draw against whatever the index holds at that instant. That is what makes
    the failure random and unreproducible, which is strictly worse than a
    failure that is merely frequent.

    A date cutoff fixes the entire tree at once without editing the 50 floating
    specs in the catalog. Measured: two cold resolves under the same cutoff
    produced byte-identical dependency trees, and the reported crash
    (``mcp 2.0.0`` → ``AttributeError: 'Server' object has no attribute
    'list_tools'``) becomes ``mcp 1.28.1`` + a clean import.

    WHY IT ASSERTS ON THE INJECTION SEAM, NOT ON A FILE
    ----------------------------------------------------
    The obvious guard — "every spec in mcp_servers.json names an exact
    version" — was rejected on evidence. That file is GITIGNORED user data
    (.gitignore:31, not tracked by git), so on a fresh clone the guard would
    scan nothing and pass vacuously; and the catalog it is populated from has
    50 floating entries and 0 pinned ones, so the assertion would demand 50
    hand-maintained pins that drift the moment upstream publishes. Both shapes
    fail for the same reason: they police the DECLARATIONS instead of the one
    place resolution actually happens.

    So this asserts the invariant where it is load-bearing: the env dict handed
    to every launcher subprocess. ``_ensure_writable_caches`` is on the stdio
    path (``_bridge.py`` calls it on the env passed to
    ``StdioServerParameters``), so covering it covers uv/uvx and npm/npx at
    once, including servers that do not exist yet.

    THE REGRESSION THIS PINS (measured 2026-07-31, introduced by the cutoff)
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    npm caches each ``npx -y <pkg>`` run as a slot under
    ``$npm_config_cache/_npx/<hash>/`` containing a ``package-lock.json``. Once
    the supply cutoff shipped, npm began reconciling new requests against those
    PRE-EXISTING locks; a lock resolved with no cutoff can name versions
    published after it, so npm declares it untrustworthy and aborts:

        npm error code ECOMPROMISED
        npm error Lock compromised

    Same cache dir, measured: cutoff ON -> ECOMPROMISED on 3/3 runs; cutoff OFF
    -> the server starts normally. ``npm cache verify`` does NOT repair it (it
    collected 86 corrupt entries and the failure persisted) because the slot is
    a materialised install tree, not content-addressed cache.

    The blast radius made this worse than the bug it was fixing: a machine that
    had never run Tofu was fine (no slots), while every EXISTING deployment
    broke on every npx-launched server the instant the cutoff landed. A change
    that alters resolution therefore OWNS the migration of trees resolved under
    the previous rules -- otherwise "reproducible" is only true of empty disks.

    WHY A MARKER FILE RATHER THAN INSPECTING THE LOCK
    --------------------------------------------------
    npm does not record ``before`` anywhere in ``package-lock.json`` (verified
    by grep), so staleness cannot be read back out of npm's own metadata. The
    reconciler stamps its own marker beside the lock, which makes the check
    exact instead of heuristic -- no version parsing, no comparing publish
    dates -- and lets already-reconciled slots be skipped, so the cost is
    one-time per slot rather than a wipe on every connect.

    THE SECOND REGRESSION THIS PINS (measured 2026-07-31)
    -----------------------------------------------------
    The first fix called the reconciler from ``_ensure_writable_caches``. That
    function runs inside the owner task, i.e. INSIDE the readiness timer, so the
    cold rebuild it forces competed with the handshake for one 65s budget
    (``MCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT * 2 + 5``). Measured across three trials, the FIRST

    into a NONDETERMINISTIC one surfacing as ``BrokenResourceError``, which is
    indistinguishable from a server that genuinely crashed. For diagnosis that
    is strictly worse, even though the average got better.

    Eviction is a cache-MIGRATION concern that happens once per cutoff change,
    not a per-spawn concern. Hence two separate assertions here:

    ``lib/mcp/types.py`` draws a deliberate line: a handshake that never
    completes means the server never came up, which is a CRASH and must fail
    fast — that is why ``MCP_CALL_TIMEOUT`` is None while
    ``MCP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`` deliberately stays. Simply raising the global
    ceiling to cover a 65s npx rebuild would erase that line and make every
    genuinely-dead server take minutes to report.

    So the wide budget is granted ONLY for the state we can positively identify
    (we just deleted this launcher's dependency tree). Both halves are pinned:
    the cold budget must actually exceed the measured rebuild range, and the
