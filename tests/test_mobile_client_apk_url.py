"""Guard the contract between the mobile-client download URL and the Android
CI workflow's published asset.

The Tofu backend's default download URL is a DIRECT deep link
(``…/releases/latest/download/<asset>``) on the **rangehow/tofu-android**
repo. For a tap on that link to resolve instead of 404ing, the in-tree
Android CI workflow (``.github/workflows/build-android-apk.yml``) must
publish a release asset whose filename is the SAME string as the one embedded
in that URL — and must publish it to that SAME repo.

Since the android source merged into this repo (2026-08-05, android/
subtree), the workflow lives in-tree, so every assertion here runs always —
there is no "workflow not locatable" skip anymore.

Assertions:
  1. Backend self-consistency: the filename at the tail of
     ``DEFAULT_MOBILE_CLIENT_URL`` equals ``MOBILE_CLIENT_APK_ASSET``, and the
     URL is a ``/releases/latest/download/`` deep link on the
     rangehow/tofu-android repo (not the bare page, not the ToFu repo — the
     ToFu release stream is desktop-versioned and would shadow the APK).
  2. Workflow pins the same asset name in the rename step AND in the
     action-gh-release ``files:`` list (no ``*.apk`` glob, which would publish
     Gradle's ``app-release.apk`` and break the deep link).
  3. The publish step targets ``repository: rangehow/tofu-android`` — without
     it the APK would land on THIS repo's release stream, where a newer
     desktop-only release would shadow ``/releases/latest`` into a 404.
  4. The workflow fires on the ``android-v*`` tag namespace ONLY (a bare
     ``v*`` trigger would race the desktop release tags v0.14.x) and is
     path-filtered to ``android/**`` (a backend-only push must not build APKs).
