"""Guards for the vertical-fill gate.

Why this file exists: the craft guide gained vertical-composition instructions
and the measured span went 58.9% → 87.0%, but that improvement was GUIDANCE
ONLY. No function measured fill, so if the next model ignored the paragraph
every frame would regress to 34% dead space with the whole suite still green —
the charter's own criterion ("if production dropped this behaviour today, would
the test go red?") answered no.

Discipline: these assert RESULTS — the findings the gate returns for a given
composition, and the findings that reach the quality verdict — never the
threshold constants. Re-tuning `MIN_VERTICAL_SPAN` cannot make them falsely
green, while removing the gate or its wiring turns them red.
