"""Guards for the motion-video visual-quality gates.

Why this file exists (all three were REAL defects found by measurement, not
review):

1. ``_gate`` read a FLAT top-level ``findings`` key, but ``hyperframes check``
   nests its findings under ``lint`` / ``runtime`` / ``layout``. Every finding
   of the merged report was silently dropped, so a composition with a fatal
   runtime error came back ``ok=False`` with ``errors == []`` — which reads as
   "failed for no reason" to every consumer, and as SUCCESS to any consumer
   that only looks at the error list.
2. The zero-LLM template named ``PingFang SC`` / ``Noto Sans CJK SC``, neither
   of which is in the renderer's auto-resolved font list. Naming an absent face
   does not get you that face; it gets a silent fallback to whatever fontconfig
   has. On a host whose only CJK face is a SERIF, the sans stack rendered serif.
3. The engine ran only the regex gate, which is structurally blind to fonts,
   contrast, runtime errors and text overflow — i.e. to everything a viewer
   describes as "no formatting".

Discipline (charter): these assert RESULTS (what the pipeline reports for a
given composition), never constants, so re-tuning the CLI invocation or the
template's font stack cannot make them falsely green.
