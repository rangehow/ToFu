"""Self-enforcing meta-guard for the NC source-restore belt.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``tests/conftest.py`` keeps ``_NC_GUARDED_SOURCES`` — a list of shipped source
files that a negative-control (NC) test byte-patches IN PLACE on disk (write a
neutered variant → run → restore in a ``finally``). The autouse
``_restore_nc_patched_sources`` fixture snapshots those files and heals any that
a crashed/interrupted test left dirty, so one aborted NC can't poison the whole
session.

The fragility that bit us: that list was HAND-MAINTAINED with no binding to
reality. When a sibling added ``test_frontend_tofu_scene_pixeldiff.py`` (which
byte-patches ``static/js/tofu-scene.js`` in place) they did NOT add the file to
the belt — so a SIGKILL of its node subprocess would have left the shipped JS
neutered with nothing to heal it. It slipped in silently exactly the way the
next such writer will, unless the registry polices ITSELF.

THIS TEST closes that gap the same way ``test_db_guard.py`` polices the
standalone-runner guard: it AST-scans every ``tests/*.py`` for an IN-PLACE write
to a shipped-source path (a repo-relative ``open(...,'w')`` / ``write_text`` /
``os.replace`` / ``shutil.copy*`` whose target resolves under ``lib/``,
``routes/`` or ``static/`` and is NOT a ``tmp_path`` / ``mkdtemp`` tree), and
asserts every such target is present in ``_NC_GUARDED_SOURCES``. A newcomer that
forgets to register turns from a silent suite-poisoner into an immediate red
test that NAMES the culprit file + the missing registry entry.
