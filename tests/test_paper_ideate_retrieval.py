"""R3 gate ② — the novelty prior set must actually retrieve NEIGHBOURS.

Owner pin #1 is "novelty = f(retrieved set), not f(model self-report)". That
only holds if the retrieval genuinely finds papers in the idea's own field.
Production evidence (research_7a444f96c65d42b5, 6 real ideas) says it did not:

  * `_novelty_prior_set` sent `title + the whole core_mechanism` — 473-558 chars
    of prose, complete with `*asterisks*`, commas and parentheses — as arXiv's
    `all:` query. 25 neighbours came back and **not one** was about KV caches,
    attention, LLMs or compression: they were gravitational-wave catalogues,
    neutrino searches and a `B⁰ₛ→μ⁺μ⁻` measurement.
  * The SAME papers (GWTC-5.0, "Deep Search for Joint Sources…") appeared in
    5 of the 6 ideas' neighbour sets — a long prose query degrades `all:` into
    near-unconstrained matching that keeps returning the most-cited
    collaboration papers. The judge compared every mechanism against the same
    handful of astrophysics papers, so the novelty axis was a CONSTANT.
  * One idea's `*difference*` tripped arXiv's parser into HTTP 500, which
    `search_arxiv` swallows into `[]`; the judge prompt then just says
    "(retrieval returned nothing)" and scores the idea anyway — pin #1 silently
    switched off while the verdict still counted.

The existing ideate suite stayed green through all of this because it injects
neighbours via `_FakeSearch` and therefore never exercised query construction.
These tests close that hole: they drive the SHIPPED code with the REAL ideas.

Corpus discipline (charter: never hand-copy production data into a harness):
the ideas are read from the real job's ``pipeline_state.json`` at run time. If
that file is gone the tests SKIP loudly rather than silently passing on a
fabricated substitute.

Network discipline: the relevance/overlap tests hit the real arXiv API and are
marked ``slow``; the sanitizer and empty-basis tests are pure and always run.
