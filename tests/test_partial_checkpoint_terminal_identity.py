"""Regression: the PARTIAL checkpoint must never persist a terminal verdict
WITHOUT its identity anchor — the third (and most durable) source of the
duplicate-agent-bubble bug.

WHY
---
Two earlier batches closed the two SNAPSHOT transports (``/api/v1/chat/poll``
and the SSE ``state`` event) via ``lib/chat/terminal_gate.py``: a snapshot
reporting a non-terminal status may not advertise ``finishReason`` / ``usage`` /
``preset``. That gate governs what goes ON THE WIRE.

``_sync_partial_to_conversation`` is NOT a snapshot transport — it WRITES TO THE
DATABASE (``conversations.messages``). Its P1a block carries the finish verdict
onto the trailing assistant message as soon as ``task['finishReason']`` exists:

    if task.get('finishReason'):
        last_msg['finishReason'] = task['finishReason']

``lib/tasks_pkg/orchestrator/_finalize.py`` stamps ``task['finishReason']`` at
L843 but only flips ``task['status'] = 'done'`` at L954 — a **110-line window**
containing the BLOCKING ``_generate_tool_summary`` LLM call. The 5-second
checkpoint timer fires inside that window routinely, so the row lands with
``finishReason`` set while the turn is still generating.

THE COMPOUNDING DEFECT: that same path never wrote ``_taskId``. Measured on the
shipped source — only ``_sync_result_to_conversation`` (the TERMINAL sync)
stamps it. So the persisted row is::

    {"finishReason": "stop", "_taskId": <absent>}

and the frontend reducer ``assistantTailIsPriorTurn`` returns **True** for that
row even when asked about its OWN task: the identity arm cannot fire without
``_taskId``, and the reload-safe ``!!finishReason`` arm does. ``connectToTask``
then pushes a fresh placeholder, deltas move to it, the original bubble freezes
mid-sentence and BOTH render — and because this one is PERSISTED, a page reload
reproduces it from the database rather than merely from live state.

THE FIX (two parts, both asserted here)
---------------------------------------
1. **Reuse the shared gate.** The trigger becomes
   ``is_terminal_status(task['status']) or task['_finalize_started_at']``
   instead of a third hand-written timing assumption. The latch is stamped at
   L953 — AFTER the 110-line window and one line before the terminal flip — so
   it precisely admits the "finalize is genuinely underway" case the P1a block
   was written for, while excluding the window that mints the contradiction.
   (P1a's intent is preserved: a checkpoint that outlives a failed terminal
   persist still leaves a populated finish bar.)
2. **Atomicity.** When the verdict IS carried, ``_taskId`` is written in the
   same block. A terminal field without its identity anchor is precisely an
   "unrecognisable-as-its-own completed turn" row.

    `finishReason` set, `status` still 'running', no finalize latch — i.e. a
    checkpoint landing inside the 110-line finalize window. The verdict must be
    WITHHELD outright, not merely accompanied by an anchor.

    WHY THIS IS STRICTER THAN "verdict ⇒ anchor" (and why the weaker form was
    not enough): a NEUTER that reverts the trigger to the original
    presence-only `if task.get('finishReason'):` still writes `_taskId`
    alongside, so a "verdict implies anchor" assertion stays GREEN and the
    timing gate looks decorative. Measured — that is exactly what happened on
    the first draft of this suite. The two halves of the fix must each be
    provable on their own, so this test pins the gate and
    `test_..._carried_with_identity` pins the atomicity.

    Withholding is also the semantically correct outcome here: during that
    window the turn genuinely has NOT settled, so any terminal field is a lie
    about live state — an anchored lie is still a lie, and it would still paint
    a settled finish bar via finish_info.js (`msg.finishReason || msg.usage`),
    which never consults the identity reducer at all.
