"""tests/test_presence_subagent_integration.py — presence fires through the
REAL SubAgent.run() path (not just direct _presence_* helper calls).

The unit tests prove each presence seam in isolation; this proves the wiring
fires end-to-end through the genuine swarm execution path:

  • Construct TWO real ``SubAgent`` instances sharing one parent ``convId`` +
    ``taskId`` + ``project_path``.
  • Stub the LLM at the dispatch boundary (``_default_dispatch_stream``) so each
    agent deterministically issues ONE ``write_file`` tool call editing the
    SAME file, then a final answer — no live model, no network.
  • Stub the tool executor so the "edit" doesn't touch disk but reports success
    (presence ``record_files`` fires on a successful file-edit tool).
  • Run both agents and assert a WITHIN-conversation conflict advisory was
    broadcast off the REAL ``lib.push.hub`` with peer keys
    ``{conv#agent-1, conv#agent-2}``.

Negative control (in-test): a second pass that NEUTERS the announce seam in
``run()`` must NOT produce the advisory — proving the test depends on the real
seam firing, not on the helper being callable.

Offline + deterministic → safe for CI.
