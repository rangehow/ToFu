"""tests/test_production_substrate.py — P6 strangler relocation guard.

Covers the P6 step of docs/PRODUCTION_PIPELINE_DESIGN.md (board epic
pt_a22189455f754206): the stage-graph contract moved from
``lib/motion_video/_stages.py`` to ``lib/production/stages.py``.

The owner's hard constraint on this step was **relocation, not rewrite**
(strangler-fig). These tests pin exactly that:

  * every public symbol resolves to the SAME object through all three paths
    (new home / package facade / legacy shim) — a re-implementation would
    produce distinct objects and fail;
  * the legacy import path still works, so no caller had to change;
  * the substrate stays capability-agnostic: ``lib.production.stages`` must
    not import motion-video / audio / LLM modules, or the "horizontal layer"
    claim is false and the next recipe inherits video baggage;
  * behaviour is unchanged end-to-end (checkpointed resume still works when
    driven through the NEW path).
