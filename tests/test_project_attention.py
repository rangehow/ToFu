"""tests/test_project_attention.py — the "needs you" single source of truth.

The star of this slice is the SEVERITY INVERSION fix. Before
``lib/conversations/project_attention.py`` existed, the always-visible
collaboration bar led with ``pendingDecisions`` (charter proposals) rendered
with emphasis, while an epic halted on a structured human question — the ONLY
item that stops a workstream indefinitely, because ``project_dispatch`` skips
it on every heartbeat — was not in the summary payload at all.

So the loudest signal was the least urgent one. These tests pin the corrected
semantics:

  • a board ``block_question`` is ``blocking``;
  • a charter proposal is ``advisory`` (agents self-commit decisions since the
    2026-07-12 de-gating — nothing stops while one is pending);
  • a COOLDOWN block is NOT an item at all (it self-expires; listing it would
    train the operator to ignore the surface) but IS counted in ``waiting``;
  • blocking items sort ahead of advisory ones.

Plus a source-level negative control: no-op the severity sort → the
"blocking first" assertion FAILS.
