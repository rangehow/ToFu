"""Regression guard: a BACKGROUND task's absolute-path write must NOT leak a
new workspace root into the process-GLOBAL registry (the project bar source).

WHY
---
``_resolve_write_path`` §2 auto-registers the nearest existing ancestor of an
absolute-path write as an extra workspace root so ``write_file('/abs/x.py')``
"just works". Historically it called ``add_project_root()`` — the GLOBAL
``_roots`` registry — even for a background ``run_task``. That registry is the
UI-facing "active project" every conversation's project bar reflects via
``get_state()``. So a task writing to a sibling repo (e.g. ``tofu-search``,
``tofu-android``) sprayed that repo onto EVERY conversation's bar, and violated
the committed 2026-06-22 invariant that "a background run_task MUST NOT mutate
the global _state/_roots" (log: ``[run_task-…] Auto-registered workspace root
…/tofu-android``).

Fix: when a ``conv_id`` is present the anchor is registered into that
conversation's OWN scoped registry (``add_conv_root``) only; the global
registry stays reserved for the interactive / no-``conv_id`` path.
``_mod_attribution`` / ``_should_record_modification`` were made
conv-scope-aware so the file-changes bar + undo journal still resolve.

This suite proves:
  1. A conv-scoped write registers in the conv registry, NOT in
     ``get_state().extraRoots``.
  2. Attribution still resolves the conv-scoped root (file-changes bar / undo
     journal keep working) — i.e. the fix is not a bare "drop it on the floor".
  3. NC (invariant): the interactive / no-conv_id path DOES still register
     globally — proving the gate is load-bearing, not a blanket disable.
