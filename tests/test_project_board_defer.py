"""tests/test_project_board_defer.py — the ``deferred`` (parked) board status.

The operator problem this closes: a human-gated epic (``§10-GATED /
design-first``) cannot reach ``project_board_complete`` autonomously, so the
heartbeat sweep re-dispatches it every ~30 min and it oscillates
``open→claimed→lease-expires→open`` forever — real token waste, and the reason
it "looks consistently unclaimed". ``defer_task`` sets a terminal-ish
``deferred`` status that STOPS that cycle while keeping the epic visible.

Two load-bearing properties, each with a byte-reverting negative control:

  • (a) A ``deferred`` epic is EXCLUDED from ``select_dispatchable`` (so the
    sweep never re-dispatches it). The guard is the ``status != 'open'`` skip
    in ``select_dispatchable`` — NC-A byte-reverts it to a ``claimed``-only
    skip → the deferred epic leaks into the candidate set → the exclusion
    assertion FLIPS.
  • (b) ``_effective_status`` does NOT reclaim a ``deferred`` epic on lease
    expiry (its reclaim is specific to ``claimed``) → no oscillation. NC-B
    byte-reverts the reclaim condition to fire for ``deferred`` too → an
    expired-lease deferred epic reads ``open`` → the no-reclaim assertion
    FLIPS.

Un-park is the existing ``reopen_task`` (``deferred → open``) — the same human
lever that revives a done/claimed epic — so normal dispatch resumes.
