"""tests/test_project_board_no_defer.py — the shelving (``deferred`` / park)
mechanism has been REMOVED at the source.

Operator problem this pins: a human would reopen a §10-gated epic ("no longer
shelve"), but an autonomous conversation re-called ``project_board_defer`` and
re-parked it — silently overriding the human decision, so the epic looked
permanently shelved. Occam's-razor fix: delete the park state entirely. The
board now has exactly three epic states (open / claimed / done); every open
epic is pushed forward at full speed, never held pending a human decision.

What this guards:
  • ``defer_task`` no longer exists on the board module, and
    ``project_board_defer`` is not routed through ``execute_board_tool``.
  • The agent-facing tool schema does NOT advertise ``project_board_defer``
    (an agent can no longer re-shelve an epic — the root cause).
  • The ``/api/v1/project/board/defer`` HTTP route is gone (404).
  • A retired ``deferred`` row is revived to ``open`` and dispatchable again.
