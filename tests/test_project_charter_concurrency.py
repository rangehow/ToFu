"""tests/test_project_charter_concurrency.py — the charter's lost-update root cause.

## What this pins

``project_charter`` stores its committed decisions as ONE JSON array in a single
column, so ``commit_charter`` is a read-modify-write: read the whole list →
append in memory → write the whole list back. Two commits that interleave inside
that window therefore CLOBBER each other — and, because the write is an
unconditional upsert, the loser is told ``ok=True``. The decision it just
"committed" is gone, and a charter decision is prompt-injected shared intent, so
a silently dropped one misleads every sibling conversation.

Measured before the fix (this is the shipped behaviour, reproduced in
``test_NC_*`` below):

    sibling appends SIB inside the window → I append MINE
    → final decisions == ['D0', 'MINE']      # SIB swallowed
    → my return value == {'ok': True, ...}   # and nothing said so

## Why the tests interleave rather than run in sequence

A SEQUENTIAL probe (sibling commits fully, THEN I commit) passes even on the
broken code, because my read happens after their write — it never enters the
window. An earlier analysis used exactly that shape and concluded "append needs
no lock", which is the opposite of the truth. Every test here therefore drives a
real interleave by hooking ``read_charter`` to fire the sibling's commit INSIDE
my read-modify-write window. If someone later "simplifies" these into sequential
calls they will pass against broken code — that is the trap this note exists to
prevent.

## The two halves

  • **append vs append** — the sibling's decision must survive my append.
  • **append vs content** — the sibling's NEW north star must survive my append.
    This is the half a naive "just retry the whole commit" fix gets wrong: it
    replays the caller's stale ``content`` over the sibling's edit, trading the
    decisions lost-update for a north-star lost-update.

``content`` and ``add_decision`` are mutually exclusive precisely so that
"a pure append" is decidable from the arguments, which is what makes replaying
one safe. The mixed call used to be accepted (the route's gate is
``content is None and not add_decision``), so the safety of a replay rested on
caller habit rather than on the signature.
