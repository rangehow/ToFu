"""tests/test_project_charter_kind_routing.py — every commit declares its kind,
and the kind decides where the text LANDS (owner-directed 2026-07-28).

## The contract under test

  invariant — a binding rule constraining FUTURE decisions. Lands in the
              charter. REQUIRES a one-line `summary` (the rule itself); the
              per-turn injection renders ONLY summaries — the full text is
              the project_charter_read detail path.
  lesson    — a methodology experience note. Routed to PROJECT MEMORY with
              BM25 dedup (same-topic lessons fold into ONE living memory,
              owner directive: "append-only variant accumulation is the
              charter-side disease, don't bring it to the memory side").
              MUST NOT grow the charter.
  report    — a completion/rejection record. REJECTED with a pointer to
              JOURNAL.md. MUST NOT grow the charter.

## Why these assertions are shaped this way

Per the charter's own guard discipline: every test asserts an OBSERVABLE
RESULT (charter decision count, memory file contents, block contents) and
never an implementation constant. The dedup test calibrates against the REAL
BM25 scorer with real same-family/cross-topic texts — measured separation is
~36 vs 0 around the 3.0 threshold, so the threshold itself is not what is
being asserted.

NEUTER x2 both bite: short-circuit the memory route -> the "lesson reaches
memory" test goes red; make the injection headline fall through to full text
-> the "summary only" test goes red.

    The kind-routing POLICY (2026-07-28) lived inside the
    ``project_charter_commit`` agent tool: reject a commit with no ``kind``;
    reject ``kind=report`` toward JOURNAL.md; route ``kind=lesson`` to project
    memory with three-channel dedup; require ``summary`` on an invariant. All of
    it was reachable ONLY from that tool, and the tool was withdrawn because a
    charter always requires human review (owner-directed 2026-07-30).

    So the eleven tests that drove it are collapsed here rather than kept green
    against code no one can reach. What they asserted is recorded so it is not
    lost:

      * missing kind / missing summary / kind=report → rejected with guidance
      * kind=lesson → project memory, never the charter, folding same-topic
        variants into ONE memory (measured: real same-family lesson pairs score
        ~0.10 lexical containment, which is WHY the explicit ``into_memory``
        channel exists — a lexical threshold alone can never catch a semantic
        family)

    The lesson path's measurement survives in ``_route_lesson_to_memory``'s
    docstring, which is now unreachable and labelled as such. Agents still
    record lessons via ``create_memory``; re-pointing that helper at the dedup
    logic is follow-up debt, deliberately NOT folded into this change.

    What this test pins is the only thing still true: the tool refuses, and it
    refuses by NAME so the refusal cannot be mistaken for a crash."""
