"""tests/test_project_dispatch.py — Pillar #5 brain-driven dispatch.

The spine that closes "无需人手": the board's open epics get STARTED without a
human. Two load-bearing properties:

  • **select_dispatchable is genuinely-pickable-only.** It must EXCLUDE an epic
    with an unfinished dependency AND an epic with a live (unexpired) claim;
    it must INCLUDE an open epic whose deps are all done. (Built on read_board,
    so an EXPIRED claim already reads open → reuses the one deadlock path.)
  • **Claim-on-dispatch = idempotency guard.** dispatch_epic claims the epic,
    so a second dispatch pass sees it claimed and does NOT re-select it — no
    concurrent double-dispatch.

Two MANDATORY source-level negative controls:
  • NC-1: no-op the dependency/claim filter in select_dispatchable → an
    unfinished-dep / live-claimed epic leaks into the candidate set → the
    exclusion test FAILS.
  • NC-2: no-op the claim-on-dispatch → after a dispatch, the epic is still
    open → a second select re-selects it → the idempotency test FAILS.
