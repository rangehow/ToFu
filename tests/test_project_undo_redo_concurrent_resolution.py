"""Concurrency regression: undo / undo-all / redo must resolve the target
project from the ROUND being acted on — never from the mutable globally-active
UI project (``_state['path']``).

Scenario (the exact multi-conversation trap):
  * Conversation A edits project A (task-A).
  * Conversation B edits project B (task-B).
  * The UI is focused on project B, so ``_state['path']`` points at B.
  * The user clicks Undo / Undo-All / Redo on conversation A's round.

Before the fix, ``/redo`` (and ``/undo-all`` with no explicit path) resolved
the project via ``_state['path']`` → project B → acted on the wrong project
(redo found no snapshot; undo-all wiped the wrong project). After the fix,
``resolve_base_path(task_id)`` recovers project A from the round's own record,
so the action targets A and B is left untouched.

This drives the REAL modification-recording + undo/redo functions and the
REAL ``resolve_base_path`` resolver. The NC blocks assert that WITHOUT the
resolver (i.e. falling back to ``_state['path']``) the action lands on the
wrong project — proving the resolver is load-bearing.
