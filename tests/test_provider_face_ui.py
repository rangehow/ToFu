"""tests/test_provider_face_ui.py — the wire face must be VISIBLE and honest.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
``lib/llm_dispatch/provider_face.py`` has owned the account/face separation
since charter #23, and it works: measured on the live config, ``claude-opus-5``
resolves to ``https://aigc.sankuai.com/v1/anthropic`` while ``kimi-k3`` stays
on ``/v1/openai/native``. But the Settings UI rendered NONE of it, so the only
way to learn which wire a model used was to read ``server_config.json`` — the
question that opened this batch.

Three surfaces were added (model-card pill, per-model pin, provider faces{}
editor). This module pins the ONE property that makes them safe.

THE CENTRAL RULE
================
The family rule ("Claude belongs on the Anthropic wire") must exist EXACTLY
ONCE, in Python. The UI asks the backend
(``POST /api/v1/providers/resolve-faces`` → ``resolve_face``) and renders the
answer.

Why this matters more than it looks: a hand-written JS copy would not fail
loudly when it drifts. It would render a pill reading ``anthropic`` on a model
that actually dispatches over the OpenAI wire — which is precisely the silent
signature-dropping shape the resolver was built to prevent, now with a green
label on top of it. A wrong pill is worse than no pill. Charter #12 bans
hand-copied backend enums for the same reason.

So the guards below assert BOTH directions:
  * the endpoint delegates to the real resolver (not a re-derivation), and
  * the frontend contains NO independent claude→anthropic decision.

#  5. ★ The third protocol ('responses') must SURVIVE the UI
#
#  Measured 2026-07-31 (epic pt_b7a29ea7 S3): the face editor hard-coded
#  ['anthropic', 'openai'], so a face configured protocol='responses'
#  rendered with the select showing 'anthropic' — and the next save wrote
#  'anthropic' back, silently flipping a working Responses provider onto
#  /messages. Two root fixes are pinned here:
#    (a) the select must OFFER 'responses' — and must PRESERVE any value
#        it doesn't know (a future fourth protocol can never be mangled
#        the same way again);
#    (b) the collect fallback must preserve the row's ORIGINAL protocol
#        (data-orig-protocol) instead of collapsing to a hard-coded one.
