"""tests/test_provider_face_ui.py — the wire face must be VISIBLE and honest.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
``lib/llm_dispatch/provider_face.py`` has owned the account/face separation
since charter #23, and it works: measured on the live config, ``claude-opus-5``
resolves to ``https://aigc.sankuai.com/v1/anthropic`` while ``kimi-k3`` stays
on ``/v1/openai/native``. But the Settings UI rendered NONE of it, so the only
way to learn which wire a model used was to read ``server_config.json`` — the
question that opened this batch.

Three surfaces were added (model-card pill, per-model pin, provider faces{}
editor). This module pins the ONE property that makes them safe.

THE CENTRAL RULE
================
The family rule ("Claude belongs on the Anthropic wire") must exist EXACTLY
ONCE, in Python. The UI asks the backend
(``POST /api/v1/providers/resolve-faces`` → ``resolve_face``) and renders the
answer.

Why this matters more than it looks: a hand-written JS copy would not fail
loudly when it drifts. It would render a pill reading ``anthropic`` on a model
that actually dispatches over the OpenAI wire — which is precisely the silent
signature-dropping shape the resolver was built to prevent, now with a green
label on top of it. A wrong pill is worse than no pill. Charter #12 bans
hand-copied backend enums for the same reason.

So the guards below assert BOTH directions:
  * the endpoint delegates to the real resolver (not a re-derivation), and
  * the frontend contains NO independent claude→anthropic decision.

#  face)" banner on a model the user simply switched OFF — an alarm whose
#  stated cause is not the real one. Charter #26: a new consumer of a
#  filtered surface MUST inventory that filter.

#  Note on L399: the predicate is ``effective_keys``, NOT "has api_keys" —
#  a brand=='local' provider with no keys is given one blank-key slot and
#  DOES build. Keying this on api_keys alone would wrongly mark every
