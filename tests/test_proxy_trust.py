"""Behaviour guard: X-Forwarded-For is NEVER trusted, and the docs say so.

Replaces the ProxyFix-wiring suite that used to live in
``tests/test_proxy_trust.py``. That suite was a "dead guard" — the most
dangerous shape in this repo (charter 2026-07-27): it was 9/9 GREEN while the
implementation it claimed to protect had never existed.

What was wrong with it (measured 2026-07-27, epic pt_30d400a167df4440):
  * Its docstring announced "Tests for TOFU_TRUST_PROXY_HOPS / Werkzeug
    ProxyFix wiring", but ``git grep ProxyFix`` outside that file matched
    only a COMMENT in ``.env.example``. The production app never installed
    ProxyFix. Not anchor drift — the guarded implementation never landed.
  * 7 of its 9 tests built their OWN mini Flask app, wrapped ProxyFix on it
    by hand, and asserted that Werkzeug behaves like Werkzeug. That is an
    upstream-library test; it can never fail because of anything in Tofu.
  * ``TestServerEnvParsing`` asserted ``int('not-a-number')`` raises
    ValueError — a Python-builtin test — under a docstring claiming "the
    production code does this", pointing at code that does not exist.
  * Its one test against the real app conceded in its own comment: "If
    ProxyFix were silently active, this still 200s" — i.e. it could not
    detect the condition it was named for.

Why ProxyFix can never be wired here (measured, not inferred):
  * ``server.py:1373`` → ``app = Quart(...)``. Quart is ASGI.
  * ``hasattr(app, 'wsgi_app')`` is **False**; ``asgi_app`` is True.
  * ``ProxyFix`` is WSGI middleware that wraps ``app.wsgi_app``.
  * Neither Quart nor Hypercorn exposes any trusted-proxy / forwarded-header
    option (probed: zero matching attributes on either class).
So "just wire up ProxyFix" is not an option that exists — the ticket's
either/or was really a single choice.

What this file guards instead — the two things that are actually TRUE and
that a future change could plausibly break:

  1. ``X-Forwarded-For`` does not influence ``request.remote_addr``. This is
     the safe default (a spoofed header must never move an IP-keyed
     decision), and the assertion is on the OBSERVED value, so it keeps
     biting if someone later adds an ASGI forwarded-header middleware
     without gating it.
  2. ``.env.example`` does not promise a trusted-proxy feature that the
     server does not implement. A config file that documents a
     non-existent security control is worse than silence: an operator who
     sets it believes real client IPs are being honoured when every
     IP-keyed decision is in fact seeing the proxy's own address.
