"""tests/test_published_dependency_identity.py — the dependency CI installs must
be the artifact we actually validated.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the third instance of one defect class)
--------------------------------------------------------
This batch closed two forms of "the thing we checked is not the thing that
ships":

  * ``test_published_pipeline_drift`` — the workflow file we validate vs the one
    GitHub runs;
  * ``test_requirements_public_resolvable`` — the dependency floor we declare vs
    what the public index can actually serve.

A third gap sat between them. ``requirements.txt`` does not say "tofu-search
0.5.3 as built and verified on the maintainer's disk"; it says "whatever public
PyPI serves for ``>=0.5.3``". Those are different artifacts and nothing compared
them. So a resolvability check can be GREEN — 0.5.3 exists! — while CI installs
a build nobody ever imported:

  * a partial upload lands the sdist but not the wheel (or vice versa), and pip
    silently builds from whichever half arrived;
  * a stale copy from a scratch directory gets uploaded instead of the artifact
    that passed ``twine check`` and the isolated-import probe;
  * the version is re-cut and re-uploaded later, and the bytes drift from the
    ones this repo's guards were run against.

None of those are exotic. All of them are silent, because every existing gate
asks about the NAME or the VERSION, never the BYTES.

WHAT THIS PINS
--------------
The SHA256 of each published file of the pinned tofu-search release, measured
locally from the artifacts that passed:

  * ``python -m build`` from a clean ``git archive HEAD`` export (NOT the
    working tree — that is what hid the unimportable-facade defect);
  * ``twine check`` PASSED on both files;
  * installed into an isolated ``--target`` and imported from a neutral cwd with
    ``PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1``, with every facade ``__all__`` symbol resolving.

If the published bytes differ from these, the thing CI installs is NOT the thing
that cleared those checks, and the release must stop.

WHY THE DIGEST COMES FROM THE API, NOT A DOWNLOAD
-------------------------------------------------
PyPI publishes ``digests.sha256`` per file in ``/pypi/<name>/<version>/json``,
and that digest is what pip itself verifies a download against. Reading it is
therefore equivalent to hashing the file, at a fraction of the bytes — and it
cannot be fooled by a proxy that rewrites content, because a rewritten body
would no longer match the digest pip checks.

Deliberately NOT via ``pip download``: this host's pip is configured against an
internal mirror (``pip.sankuai.com``), so a pip-mediated check could hash a
DIFFERENT artifact than the public one CI resolves. Same discipline as the
resolvability guard — verify the deployed artifact, on the index that actually
serves CI.

MAINTENANCE
-----------
Raising the tofu-search floor means republishing and updating both digests here,
in the same commit. That is the point: the hash is a deliberate speed bump on
changing a hard dependency, and it forces the new artifact to be verified the
same way. When the pin and ``requirements.txt`` disagree, the test says so
rather than silently checking a version nobody depends on any more.
