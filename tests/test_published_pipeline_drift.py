"""tests/test_published_pipeline_drift.py — the file we VALIDATE must be the
file that RUNS.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``tests/test_desktop_build_workflow.py`` pins 30+ invariants about the release
pipeline — the trigger, the runner labels, the completeness gate, the orphan-tag
retarget. Every one of them reads ``_ROOT / '.github/workflows/build-desktop.yml'``,
i.e. the LOCAL file. That file has been correct since 2026-07-29.

The file GitHub Actions actually executed for v0.15.0 / v0.15.1 / v0.15.2 was a
2026-07-23 copy still carrying ``on: push tags: v*`` and the retired ``macos-13``
label. Measured on the real repo: all three runs ended ``cancelled`` after the
x86_64 leg sat queued for exactly 24 h against a label GitHub retired on
2025-12-08, so ``release`` was skipped by ``needs:`` and nothing shipped.

So the guard suite was GREEN throughout a three-release outage, and structurally
had to be: nothing in it compares the validated file to the deployed one. That
is the defect class this module closes — **no consistency check existed between
the local source of truth and the artifact actually running in production.**

HOW THE DRIFT HAPPENS (measured, not inferred)
----------------------------------------------
``export.py`` publishes by re-``git init``-ing a sanitized copy and pushing it
over the mirror; ``_push_branch`` force-pushes on a non-fast-forward rejection.
It is a ONE-WAY overwrite: the local tree is the only source of truth and the
remote is a projection of it.

That is a coherent design, but it has a silent failure mode. Commit ``128ad422``
("fix Intel leg — retired macos-13 -> macos-15-intel") was authored directly on
the downstream repo and shipped v0.14.2 successfully. It never flowed back
upstream. Verified here: ``git merge-base --is-ancestor 128ad422 HEAD`` is
false, and fetching ``origin/main`` reports
``+ 128ad422...59bc8254 main -> origin/main (forced update)`` — the next export
force-pushed straight over the fix, restoring ``macos-13`` and re-breaking the
pipeline. No error, no log line, no failing test.

A downstream-only edit is therefore not merely lost: it is REVERTED, and the
revert is invisible. This guard makes that state observable BEFORE the next push
instead of three unreleased versions later.

WHY BYTE-EQUALITY IS THE RIGHT ASSERTION
----------------------------------------
Only because it was measured to be achievable. An opensource export applies a
CHAIN of transforms (``export.py`` 2488-2490): restore whitelisted keep-files,
then ``ruff check --fix --unsafe-fixes`` over the whole tree, then verify. The
composed chain was measured to be the IDENTITY on every guarded path, and
``test_guarded_paths_survive_the_whole_export_transform_chain`` keeps it that
way — modelling only the sanitizer would miss ruff, which really does get a vote
on ``scripts/release_assets.py``.

So "published == local" is a real invariant for these files, not an
approximation, and any weaker comparison (parse-and-compare-fields) would
re-admit the exact bug: a field nobody thought to compare.

Do NOT extend ``_GUARDED_PATHS`` to a file the export rewrites — this test would
then be permanently red for a legitimate reason, and a permanently-red guard
gets muted, which is how a suite goes blind. Add such a file only with a
transform-then-compare variant.

WHY BOTH REMOTES
----------------
``export.py::_GIT_REPOS['opensource']`` pushes to TWO remotes: ``rangehow/ToFu``
and ``NiuTrans/ToFu``. Both were measured at the same stale ``59bc8254``. A guard
covering only the first would call the fleet clean while half of it was stale.

WHY A SKIP (AND NOT A PASS) WHEN OFFLINE
-----------------------------------------
The evidence lives on the network. Unreachable network means the invariant was
NOT CHECKED, and reporting "not checked" as "consistent" is precisely the shape
of lie this module was written to eliminate. Offline therefore skips loudly.
