"""Guard: a hanging test must abort itself, not stall the run to the ceiling.

WHY
---
2026-07-27, while NEUTER-testing the agent-loop no-progress breaker, deleting
the fingerprint comparison did NOT turn the suite red — it made it HANG. The
breaker is the only exit from an infinite dispatcher, so removing it leaves
the test spinning forever. That is a legitimate NEUTER bite, but it is only
*observable* if pytest aborts the wedged test on its own.

MEASURED at the time (two separate defects, one of which was my own error):

  1. My first probe reported ``ImportError: No module named pytest_timeout``.
     That was a MEASUREMENT ERROR — it ran ``/usr/bin/python``, not the
     project interpreter. pytest-timeout 2.4.0 *is* installed in the conda
     env and ``pyproject.toml`` has declared it since before this incident.
  2. The REAL defect: no default timeout is configured anywhere, so the
     installed plugin never fires. Probe: a ``time.sleep(600)`` test ran
     until an EXTERNAL ``timeout 25`` killed the shell (pytest emitted no
     verdict at all); with ``--timeout=5`` the same test self-aborted in
     5.04s with a clean FAILED line.

A hang that only an external kill can stop is indistinguishable from an
infrastructure stall, and it silently un-verifies every hang-shaped NEUTER in
the suite. So the default belongs in config, where every invocation inherits
it — not in the muscle memory of whoever happens to run pytest.

NOTE on ``PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1`` (this project's standard test
env, per the user's convention): it suppresses entry-point autoloading, so
pytest-timeout must be named explicitly via ``-p pytest_timeout`` in
``addopts`` for the setting to take effect under that env too. Both halves
are asserted below — the timeout VALUE and the explicit plugin LOAD — because
either alone leaves the guard inert.
