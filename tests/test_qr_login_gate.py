"""tests/test_qr_login_gate.py — QR-tab hard gate for the SSO login capture.

``tests/_qr_login_capture.py`` screenshots the SSO login page so a human can
scan it. The original implementation switched to the QR tab with a JS click and
trusted its own return value:

    clicked = page.evaluate(...)   # True == "I dispatched a click"

``True`` there proves only that the switch element was found and a click event
was dispatched — NOT that the tab actually changed. On a miss the script
screenshotted the PASSWORD form and reported success, handing the operator an
unscannable image. So a hard gate now stands between the click and the
screenshot: :func:`_wait_for_qr` must positively identify a visible QR.

The gate's own first version then repeated the very mistake it was written to
prevent. Its judgement was purely GEOMETRIC ("visible, >=120px, ratio
0.8–1.25"), and the login page's brand illustration — measured at 540x468,
ratio 1.15 — sails straight through it. Measured on the live page: the gate
returned ``img 540x468`` while the PASSWORD form was on screen.

That measurement is the regression sample below. The rule it encodes:
**a gate must itself judge on the real condition, not on a looser approximation
of it.** The fix anchors on CONTEXT — square-ish AND inside a container that
announces QR login AND that container holds no password input.

These tests run offline against synthetic DOMs (no network, no SSO), so they
guard the judgement rather than the site.
