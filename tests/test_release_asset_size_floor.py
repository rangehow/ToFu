"""tests/test_release_asset_size_floor.py — a NAMED asset is not a VALID asset,
and a shared table's SHAPE is part of its contract.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Run 30601806258 produced a correctly-named Windows installer containing
essentially none of the application:

    hollow build     Tofu-Setup-…-win64.exe        48,960,018 bytes
    healthy v0.14.2  Tofu-Setup-0.14.2-win64.exe  115,822,886 bytes

The completeness gate matched it on filename and called the set complete. Only
the other three legs failing at the same time stopped ``make_latest`` from
pinning a 49 MB hollow installer as Latest — luck, not a gate.

So the gate now carries a per-platform size floor (70% of the measured v0.14.2
size), and this module pins both halves of that:

  1. the floor actually rejects the measured hollow artifact and actually
     accepts the measured healthy one — using the REAL byte counts, so the
     thresholds are anchored to observed reality rather than to a round number
     someone liked;
  2. every consumer of ``PLATFORM_ASSETS`` survives the row widening.

WHY (2) IS HERE AND NOT AN AFTERTHOUGHT
----------------------------------------
Adding the floor widened each row from 4 fields to 5, and
``routes/api_v1/desktop.py::_match_platform_assets`` unpacks rows positionally
(``for _os, _arch, label, pattern in rows``). That broke instantly and
SILENTLY: the route wraps its table load in ``except Exception`` and degrades
to the releases page, so a production symptom would have been "the download
button quietly stopped offering direct links" — with the release gates still
green, because they use the table differently.

That is the same defect class as everything else in this batch: a single source
of truth is only single if every consumer agrees on its SHAPE, and positional
unpacking makes shape a load-bearing, invisible contract. Pinning the arity
turns the next widening into a red test instead of a degraded feature.
