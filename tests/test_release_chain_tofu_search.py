"""tests/test_release_chain_tofu_search.py — the release chain must be able
to SATISFY the tofu-search floor, not merely declare it.

WHY THIS EXISTS (pt_84e6828ee5f44a7c)
-------------------------------------
``requirements.txt`` pins ``tofu-search>=0.5.3`` — a HARD floor: the bridge
passes ``allow_private_hosts`` to ``configure()`` unconditionally, so an older
library crashes the server AT BOOT (same shape as the 0.5.0 deadline kwargs).
But 0.5.3 is on NO pip index: public PyPI tops at 0.5.1 (measured
2026-07-31, pinned by tests/test_requirements_public_resolvable.py — RED
until the publish), and the internal mirror carries none. The only verified
0.5.3 artifacts live in the sibling repo's ``dist/``.

So the chain must carry the floor itself, at all three of its points:

  1. **export** — ``_bundle_tofu_search_wheel`` used to skip opensource on
     the assumption "a vanilla host reaches public PyPI fine". Measured
     false; the wheel is bundled for EVERY mode now.
  2. **CI** — each build-desktop.yml leg installs the bundled wheel BEFORE
     ``pip install -r requirements.txt``, so pip sees the floor as already
     satisfied. Absence + an index that lacks the floor fails LOUD at the
     install step, never a hollow build (run 30601806258).
  3. **the floor itself is documented** — the 0.5.3 bump landed with the
     comment block ending at 0.5.2, an undocumented pin that begged to be
     "fixed" by lowering. The rationale is now written down and marked HARD.

The actual PUBLISH (push v0.5.3 to GitHub + PyPI) is human-gated and
tracked on the board; these guards hold the line in the meantime and keep
holding it afterwards (the wheel bundle is then simply redundant, and the
CI step harmless).
