"""tests/test_requirements_public_resolvable.py — a published tree must be
INSTALLABLE, not merely identical.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the second instance of one defect class)
----------------------------------------------------------
``tests/test_published_pipeline_drift.py`` closed "the file we validate is not
the file that runs". This closes its sibling: **"the dependency we declare is
not a dependency anyone can install."**

Measured 2026-07-31 on run 30601806258 (the first run that actually reached a
verdict after the macos-13 starvation was fixed): three of four platform legs
failed at ``Install dependencies``. ``requirements.txt`` pins
``tofu-search>=0.5.3``; public PyPI's newest release is ``0.5.1``. The
constraint is UNSATISFIABLE from a clean machine, so the release could not be
built — and, worse, neither could a first-time user's ``pip install -r``.

The drift guard cannot see this, and that is not a bug in it. The published
``requirements.txt`` genuinely matches the local one (modulo the sanitizer), so
byte-equality is GREEN while the tree is uninstallable. Byte-equality is a
necessary condition, never a sufficient one: what makes a requirement valid is a
fact about a THIRD PARTY (the public index) that neither copy models.

WHY THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT HID IT
--------------------------------
This machine has ``tofu-search 0.5.2`` installed and its pip is configured
against an internal mirror (``pip.sankuai.com``). Every local check therefore
looked satisfiable. The defect is only visible from a machine that resolves
against the PUBLIC index, which is exactly what a GitHub runner — and every
external user — is.

That is why this test pins ``https://pypi.org/pypi/...`` EXPLICITLY and never
shells out to ``pip``: a ``pip`` subprocess would inherit this host's
``index-url`` and quietly answer a different question, producing a green light
for the wrong index. A guard that measures the wrong thing is the failure mode
both of these modules exist to eliminate.

WHY NOT JUST LOWER THE FLOOR
-----------------------------
Deliberately NOT the fix. The comment block above the pin records that ``0.5.0``
is a HARD floor (an older ``configure()`` raises TypeError on the deadline
kwargs, so the server dies at boot) and ``0.5.2`` carries the identity-fallback
seams. Lowering the floor would trade "installable" for "installs something
degraded" — the failure would move from the build log into runtime behaviour,
where nobody is watching. The correct fix is always to PUBLISH the dependency.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLAIM
------------------------
It checks that each declared constraint has at least one candidate on the public
index. It is NOT a full resolver: it cannot prove the transitive graph is
co-satisfiable, and it does not check wheels-per-platform. Those need a real
resolve in CI. This catches the specific, recurring, silent case — a floor
raised against a version that was never published — at zero build cost.
