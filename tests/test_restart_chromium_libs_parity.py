"""tests/test_restart_chromium_libs_parity.py — the two-launcher invariant.

Measured hole (owner review, 2026-08-03): the FUSE root-cause fix for
headless-Chromium launch storms wires ``CHROMIUM_EXTRA_LIB_DIRS`` into
``restart_15000.sh`` — but ``deploy/supervisor/tofu.conf`` is a SECOND,
mutex-locked launcher (the restart script REFUSES to run while supervisord
owns tofu). Its ``environment=`` line carried only PORT/BIND_HOST/HOME/LANG,
so the moment the box flips to supervisor management (the documented durable
direction) the variable has NO path into the server process and the FUSE fix
silently evaporates — with every sign pointing at "already fixed".

The invariant: BOTH launchers must carry the override (and the fontconfig
half — env/etc/fonts rides the same FUSE mount, a bad window there renders
every glyph as nothing). This suite pins that structurally so a future edit
to one launcher can't strand the other.
