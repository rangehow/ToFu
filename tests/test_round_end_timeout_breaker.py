"""Guard: the tool-timeout FORCE STOP exit pairs its ROUND_START with a
ROUND_END (epic pt_a1895646a571439d).

WHY
---
run_task emits ROUND_START at the top of EVERY round the model runs
(RENDER_CONTRACT Phase 3). Every exit path closed that boundary — budget
(x2), aborted-before-tools, natural tools end — EXCEPT the consecutive-
tool-timeout FORCE STOP, whose ``break`` skipped the emit, stranding the
round's START unpaired (the reducer's ``_currentRound`` would dangle for
any consumer that reconciles boundaries).

The fix emits ``ROUND_END reason='tool_timeout'`` right before the break.
That new reason value is wire-safe BECAUSE the frontend reducer's
``round_end`` case never reads ``ev.reason`` (it only clears
``_currentRound``) — reason is informational only. These four pins lock
both halves of that contract:

  1. The breaker branch emits ROUND_END reason='tool_timeout' BEFORE its
     break (failing-first: RED on the pre-fix source).
  2. Every ROUND_END emit site in _run.py uses a SANCTIONED reason — the
     closed enumeration, kept in sync with the events.py registry.
  3. The events.py ROUND_END registry entry documents 'tool_timeout' (the
     machine-discoverable contract, /api/v1/capabilities).
  4. TOLERANCE pin: stream_reducer.js's round_end case body does NOT
     branch on ``reason`` — if a future edit makes the reducer
     reason-sensitive, this pin forces a deliberate re-audit of the
     sanctioned-reason list in lockstep.
