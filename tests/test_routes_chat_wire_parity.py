"""Wire-parity baseline for the routes/chat.py sub-package split
(board epic ``pt_04686ac6054a451e``).

The plan: routes/chat.py (~2500 lines) is being decomposed into a
``routes/chat/`` sub-package (``_helpers.py`` first slice, then eventually
``send.py`` / ``stream.py`` / ``poll_abort.py``), with ``routes/chat.py``
kept as a **re-export facade** so import contracts and Blueprint
registrations stay byte-identical. Landed so far:

  * Slice 1 → ``routes/chat_helpers.py``: 5 pure utilities with NO
    module-level mutable state (``_dumps_yielding`` /
    ``_running_checkpoint_verdict`` / ``_log_poll_task_id_mismatch`` /
    ``_loads_yielding`` / ``_warm_resume_serviceable``).
  * Slice 2 → ``routes/chat_state.py``: the send-abort marker BUNDLE
    (``_send_abort_marker`` dict + ``_send_abort_marker_lock`` +
    ``_mark_conv_aborted`` / ``_was_aborted_after`` — the four items
    that share ONE piece of module-level state; they must live in the
    same module and be re-exported through routes.chat as a set so
    nobody imports half of the pair).
  * Slice 3 → ``routes/chat_side_effects.py``: ``_truncate_conv_history``
    (the IO-heavy helper that clears the message-queue + server-message
    -store side channels after a conv history truncate). Kept OUT of
    ``chat_helpers.py`` to preserve that module's "pure + import-
    lightweight" invariant; kept OUT of ``chat_state.py`` because it
    owns no state (it acts on state living in OTHER lib.* packages).

All three slices keep ``routes/chat.py`` importable via re-export
blocks so every ``from routes.chat import _X`` call site keeps working
unchanged.

This test is the CONTRACT the split must preserve. It runs BEFORE and AFTER
the extraction; the numbers must match. It intentionally does NOT hardcode
the current URL list (that would break every legitimate future add), it
SNAPSHOTS the current registered rules at import time and stashes them as a
frozenset — the split preserves the frozenset (proof: import → derive same
frozenset). A future genuine route add DOES update the snapshot, an
accidental route drop does not.

Two layers:

  1. Symbol-level: the 5 helpers being extracted this slice + 3 more
     imported by existing tests (_mark_conv_aborted / _was_aborted_after /
     _truncate_conv_history / _start_task_for_conv) MUST remain importable
     under their ``routes.chat`` names — the sibling tests that call
     ``from routes.chat import _dumps_yielding`` etc. MUST keep working
     without edit.

  2. Wire-level: every route rule registered on ``chat_bp`` and
     ``api_v1_chat_bp`` — url pattern, method set, endpoint name — is
     preserved. Anyone breaks a rule (renames endpoint, drops a method,
     mistypes /api/chat/… vs /api/v1/chat/…) trips this test.
