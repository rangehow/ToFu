"""Acceptance gate for the live run_command countdown (epic pt_1a82ffb3).

THE REQUIREMENT
---------------
A `run_command` that declared a `timeout` must render a real-time countdown,
and — the part that is easy to fake — that countdown must SURVIVE switching
conversations. It must resume from where it was, never restart from zero.

WHY A DB ROUND-TRIP AND NOT A REDUCER UNIT TEST
-----------------------------------------------
"Persisted" is a claim about the DATABASE, so a reducer-only test cannot
falsify it. Three independent holes each break persistence while leaving a
reducer test perfectly green, and each is pinned below:

  1. `tool_progress` had NO branch in the pure reducer, so everything it
     carried lived only on the live path and was absent from
     `projectColdSnapshot` (test_reducer_folds_deadline_from_tool_progress +
     test_cold_projection_preserves_deadline).
  2. Neither periodic checkpoint fires during a long command — the
     orchestrator's runs after a round COMPLETES, the stream's on a content
     delta — so whether a running round reached the DB at all was a race. The
     spawn callback now forces one write (see `_make_run_command_spawn_cb`),
     proven end-to-end by
     test_running_round_with_deadline_survives_a_real_db_roundtrip.
  3. Both checkpoint writers early-returned when content+thinking were empty,
     which is exactly a tool-only turn
     (test_tool_only_turn_is_checkpointed_despite_empty_prose).

Plus the reason the deadline cannot be computed on the client at all:
the effective budget is the requested timeout AFTER the cross-DC multiplier
and the MAX_COMMAND_TIMEOUT clamp
(test_deadline_reflects_effective_budget_not_the_requested_one).

NOTE on scope: `run_command` resolves timeout=None BY DESIGN (no ceiling,
pinned by tests/test_no_backend_timeouts.py), so most commands have NO
deadline. For those the truthful display is the ELAPSED count-up, which is why
the renderer covers both and why no cap was introduced to manufacture a
countdown.
