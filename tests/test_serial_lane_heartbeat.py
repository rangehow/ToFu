"""tests/test_serial_lane_heartbeat.py — pt_9f5a51ba45bd423c.

THE DEFECT
----------
``_start_tool_heartbeat`` was wired into ONE of the three dispatch lanes of
``execute_tool_pipeline``: the parallel read-only pool. The two SERIAL lanes
ran ``_execute_tool_one`` bare, so a tool blocking there emitted nothing at
all — and the stuck-task reaper's discriminator is exactly "both liveness
clocks silent past ``TOFU_STUCK_TASK_MAX_SILENT_SECS`` (1800s)".

Measured in production 2026-07-31 (logs/app.log), two tasks, same shape:

  task 38562f78 (conv ms8bx708)  run_command @10:46:54 → reaped 11:17:40
  task 31d08c82 (conv ms8c54p5)  run_command @        → reaped 11:18:41

both ``no event/dispatch progress for 1846s``, both ``finish=aborted`` with the
process group killed, ¥22.95 + ¥12.01 of completed rounds discarded. The user
saw a bubble reading "内部错误 / Internal error — 请查看服务器日志".

Three properties are pinned here, each independently NEUTER-able:

1. **Serial WRITE lane heartbeats** (``run_command``, ``write_file``, every
   non-readOnly MCP tool — ``_task_partitions`` puts them all in the write
   partition). This is the lane that produced both production casualties.

2. **Long-blocking serial lane heartbeats** (``_SERIAL_BLOCKING_TOOLS``).
   ``_heartbeat.py``'s own comment asserts these are reaper-immune because
   "the heartbeat below keeps refreshing ``_dispatch_heartbeat``" — MEASURED
   FALSE for ``await_task``: ``lib/scheduler/executor/_await.py`` contains
   zero ``_dispatch_heartbeat`` writes and zero ``append_event`` calls, and
   its own wait is capped at 3600s, i.e. twice the reap threshold. Only
   ``ask_human`` (self-bumps in ``lib/tasks_pkg/human_guidance.py``) and
   ``timer_create`` (emits ``append_event`` per poll) were genuinely covered.
   So the comment documented a protection that did not exist for one of its
   three members.

3. **The reaper's error envelope is ``worker_lost``, not ``internal``.**
   ``internal`` is ``retryable=False`` and its hint is "go read
   logs/error.log" — for an event the user can neither diagnose nor act on.
   ``worker_lost`` already exists in ``KINDS`` / ``_RETRYABLE_KINDS`` /
   ``_WARNING_KINDS`` / ``_TITLES`` with a frontend chip and both i18n keys,
   and its hint states the one true recovery: re-running is safe.

WHY A HEARTBEAT AND NOT A TIMEOUT
---------------------------------
Capping the wait was considered and is FORBIDDEN by a ratified decision
recorded at ``lib/tasks_pkg/tool_dispatch/_heartbeat.py`` (2026-07-25, epic
pt_1acd0bcdb2174566 F4, option A): "Do NOT 'fix' this by capping the
heartbeat; the cap question was decided as status-quo." ``run_command``
likewise resolves ``timeout=None`` by design and is pinned by
``tests/test_no_backend_timeouts.py``. Aliveness is proven by BEATING.
