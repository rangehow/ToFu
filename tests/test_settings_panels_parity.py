"""Closed-system guard for the settings-panel HTML-fragment injection.

Panels were decoupled out of ``index.html`` into ``static/settings_panels/<tab>.html``
fragments, spliced back at render time by ``lib/settings_panels.inject_panels``
(see the settings decoupling batch, 2026-07-18). This is the SAME class of trap
the JS-bundler allowlist guards (CLAUDE.md §3.2.1): a marker with no fragment,
or a fragment with no marker, or a fragment edit that doesn't invalidate the
served-HTML cache, silently makes a settings tab vanish or go stale.

These tests assert the whole loop is closed so any of those breaks fails HERE
instead of as a mysteriously-missing settings page in the browser.

# (.settings-*, .stg-btn-*, .settings-toggle, …) intentionally stays in
# styles.css and is NOT listed here.

# NOTE: this list grows per CSS-migration commit (A→B→C). An entry is added
