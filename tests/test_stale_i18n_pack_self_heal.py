"""Guards for the i18n-pack branch of ``resolve_stale_bundle`` + pack cleanup.

WHAT WENT WRONG (2026-07-29, observed in production)
----------------------------------------------------
``_BUILT_BUNDLE_RE`` admits THREE kinds of built artifact — ``bundle-``,
``feature-`` and ``i18n-<lang>-`` — but ``resolve_stale_bundle`` classified
them TWO ways::

    if filename.startswith('bundle-'):  current = get_bundle_filename()
    else:                # 'feature-'   current = get_feature_bundle_filename()

so every stale i18n pack fell into the ``feature-`` branch. The server logged
the consequence verbatim::

    [StaleBundle] Self-healing stale request:
        i18n-zh-9e07255b.js -> feature-92a75489.js

That single mis-redirect produces the whole observed failure, because when
packs are active the core bundle EXCLUDES ``i18n.js`` (js_bundler.py:1306) —
the pack is the ONLY copy of ``_i18n`` / ``_i18nLang`` / ``t()``:

  * every string renders as its raw key (``collab.needsYou``);
  * the language falls back to index.html's static text, which is mostly
    English, so a zh user sees an English UI;
  * the feature bundle executes TWICE (once in the pack's slot, once in its
    own) → ``Identifier '_igGenerating' has already been declared`` → boot
    dies mid-flight and the loading spinner never resolves.

WHY IT WAS INVISIBLE: tests/test_stale_bundle_self_heal.py's
``test_resolver_is_pure_and_precise`` enumerates ``bundle-``, ``feature-``,
``core.js``, ``bundle-loader.js``, ``''`` and ``None`` — every kind EXCEPT a
pack. The regex was extended to admit packs without the resolver's branch or
its guard following.

The second defect, which MANUFACTURED the stale request: ``emit_pack_files``
deleted non-current packs with no age grace, while the bundle cleaner protects
young artifacts for ``_BUILT_ARTIFACT_GRACE_S`` (2h). A page served seconds
before a rebuild had its pack deleted out from under it.
