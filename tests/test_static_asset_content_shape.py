"""tests/test_static_asset_content_shape.py — a file must contain its own language.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (pt_b62849184ede40d8)
------------------------------------------
``static/styles.css`` was once overwritten wholesale with PYTHON source — a
tool-execution pipeline module, ``# HOT_PATH`` banner and all. Measured at the
time: 22291 lines → 1048, ``data-theme`` selectors 1680 → 0, and the file
happily ``ast.parse``-d. 87 test files read that stylesheet, so the whole band
went red at once.

WHAT MADE IT EXPENSIVE WAS NOT THE BREAKAGE, IT WAS THE DIAGNOSIS
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Every one of those 87 suites failed with a message like ``no
[data-theme=tofu] .folder-badge rule found``. That points at a MISSING
SELECTOR — so the natural reading is "someone deleted a CSS rule", and the
investigation starts in the wrong place entirely. Nothing anywhere said the
plainer truth: *this file is not CSS any more*. Two separate sessions burned
time on that misdirection (it also silently invalidated an equivalence probe
that had been comparing two comment-strippers on what it believed was CSS).

WHY THE EXISTING GUARD IS NOT THIS GUARD
----------------------------------------
``tests/test_write_freshness_gate.py`` ends with
``assert os.path.getsize(root / 'static/styles.css') > 512 * 1024``. That WOULD
have caught this particular clobber (the corrupt file was ~42 KB), but its own
comment says what it is for: *"Sanity the guard itself reads the real tree"* —
it is a fixture check for the freshness threshold, not a corruption tripwire.
It is also size-only, so the mirror case — a clobber of roughly the right SIZE
but the wrong LANGUAGE — sails straight through it.

So this file asserts the property directly: an asset must look like the
language its extension claims. Cheap, O(files), and it fails with a message
that names the actual problem.

DELIBERATELY NARROW
-------------------
This is a shape check, not a linter. It asserts only what is unambiguous:

  * a ``.css`` file must contain CSS-ish structure (declaration blocks) and
    must NOT parse as a Python module;
  * a ``.js`` file must not parse as a Python module either.

It does NOT try to validate CSS grammar or JS syntax — ``node --check`` and the
bundler guards already cover JS, and a half-written CSS parser here would be
the "second hand-written implementation" charter #24 exists to prevent.
