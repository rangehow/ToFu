"""Test #2 of the sync-robustness pass (2026-06-25): the FIRST streaming delta
checkpoints to DB immediately, closing the pre-first-checkpoint crash-loss window.

Before: ``stream_llm_response`` initialised ``_last_stream_ckpt = time.time()``,
so the throttled ``_maybe_checkpoint_during_stream`` could not fire until 5s
into streaming. A server crash after the first tokens but before the 5s tick
lost the whole turn. Now it inits to 0.0 → the first content/thinking delta
triggers a checkpoint, then the 5s cadence resumes.

We drive ``stream_llm_response`` with a stubbed ``dispatch_stream`` that emits
two content deltas, and a stubbed ``checkpoint_task_partial`` recorder; we
assert the checkpoint fired on the first delta (not deferred 5s).
