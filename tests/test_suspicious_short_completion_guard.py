"""Behavior guard: a suspicious short stop-completion must NOT overwrite the
multi-round accumulated work that preceded it.

WHY
---
2026-07-28 09:51–10:45 incident: the sankuai gateway intermittently returned a
29-char canned greeting ("Hi! How can I help you today?") with
``finish_reason=stop`` for every Opus 5 request, 68 times, each with a real
M-TraceId. Tasks that had just spent N rounds doing real tool work (e.g.
conv ms40kfqq: 2×searchFlights ×195KB + run_command) then had their FINAL round
replaced by that greeting — and ``_finalize_and_emit_done`` persisted
``task['content']`` (the last round's 29 chars) over the whole accumulated
answer. The user saw one greeting; the real deliverable was silently lost.

``_check_suspicious_completion`` already DETECTS this shape
(``short_content_after_tool_calls(<50chars)``, fired 54× that day) — but it
only ``logger.warning``s. Nothing stops the overwrite.

This guard pins the interception BEHAVIOUR (assert the RESULT, not the
implementation — charter: "assert outcomes, not code anchors"):

  * when the terminal round is a short ``stop`` after tool work AND the
    turn accumulated substantial inter-round prose (``assistantContent``
    on prior tool rounds, kept verbatim by ``_discard_pretool_prose``),
    the delivered content MUST keep that accumulated work — not collapse
    to the short residue;
  * a genuinely short turn (no substantial prior narration — the model
    really did just answer briefly) is left untouched;
  * a normal long final answer persists byte-identically (no
    interception, no false positive — the complement).

NEUTER (reverse proof): remove the interception call in ``_finalize.py``
and the first test flips red; make it fire unconditionally and the
complement tests flip red. Both directions are pinned here.
