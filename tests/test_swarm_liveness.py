"""tests/test_swarm_liveness.py — guards for the swarm's THREE independent clocks.

Measured incident (conv ms8c68l0ppwfcw, 2026-07-31) — three separate deadlines,
none of which asked whether work was being produced:

  1. ``master._start_driver`` called ``iter_completions()`` with no argument and
     inherited ``scheduler.iter_completions(timeout=600.0)``. At exactly 600.0s
     the driver abandoned two RUNNING agents, set ``_terminated``, shut the pool
     down and persisted ``settled:true``. ``await_agents`` then told the model
     the ids "will NEVER complete" — ``orphans`` delivered 21 minutes later
     (``elapsed=2023.1s``, 1,091,830 tokens). The abandoned agents rendered as
     "无结果" because ``_build_agent_snapshot`` coerces resultless agents to
     ``unknown`` once ``terminated`` is set. 56 historical occurrences.

  2. ``SubTaskSpec.timeout_seconds=1800`` is evaluated only in ``before_round``,
     so an agent blocked INSIDE a tool never reaches the check. ``coder-tests``
     sat in a ``pytest`` child for over an hour and never tripped it.

  3. ``_session_timestamps[key]`` is written once, in ``_set_session`` at spawn,
     and never refreshed; ``_cleanup_stale_sessions`` calls ``session.abort()``
     at TTL. Its ``_key_is_live`` shield only looks for a non-terminal CHAT
     task, which is precisely what a fire-and-forget swarm does not have.
     105 historical occurrences.

The fix is one shared liveness fact (``lib/swarm/liveness.ProgressBeacon``) that
all three consult, so none of them can independently decide a busy agent is
finished. These tests are BEHAVIOURAL — they drive the real scheduler/master
with fake agents rather than asserting on source text, because the defect being
guarded is "a deadline fires while work is in flight", which only a running
loop can demonstrate.
