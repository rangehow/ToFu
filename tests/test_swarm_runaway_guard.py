"""Production-path guard: the swarm SubAgent cannot spin forever.

WHY
---
2026-07-27 incident: sub-agent `agent-researcher-6b62ec57` ran 26,683,114
rounds in 3.5h and wrote 53,366,229 lines = 9.1 GB into logs/app.log (96% of
the whole file). The 9 GB was the SYMPTOM; the defect is that NOTHING in the
production path bounds a wedged loop:

  * ``SubTaskSpec.max_rounds = 0``       → "unlimited" → the 2**30 ceiling
  * ``SubTaskSpec.timeout_seconds = 0``  → "unlimited" → the wall-clock halt
                                            hook returns None every round

Both are DATACLASS DEFAULTS, not test-fixture settings, so any caller that
omits them gets `unlimited + unlimited`. The stub dispatcher in the incident
merely made it fast (2100 rounds/s); against a real gateway the same loop
does not stop either — it just burns money more slowly.

The chassis breaker (`max_consecutive_no_progress_rounds`, added alongside
this suite) is inert until a caller passes it, and a wall-clock net that
defaults to "off" is not a net. These tests pin BOTH ends:

  1. the chassis breaker is actually WIRED by SubAgent (not left at 0), and
  2. `SubTaskSpec` can no longer express `unlimited + no timeout`.

NEUTER evidence expected: removing the
``max_consecutive_no_progress_rounds=`` argument from the ``run_agent_loop``
call in ``lib/swarm/agent.py`` must make ``test_wedged_subagent_halts`` hang
→ its own bounded dispatcher raises, turning the test red.

        The original form of this test required ``timeout_seconds != 0``, i.e.
        it demanded a WALL CLOCK specifically. That mechanism was measured to
        fail in both directions and has been replaced, so the assertion is now
        written against the PROPERTY the incident actually needs — "a default
        agent is bounded" — rather than against one particular implementation
        of it:

          * the wall clock could not catch the hang it was added for: it is
            evaluated only in ``before_round``, so an agent blocked inside a
            tool never reaches it (measured: >1h in a ``pytest`` child, never
            tripped);
          * and it DID cut down healthy long agents, because it keys on total
            runtime (measured legitimate runs: 1809s / 1846s / 1903s).

        The bounds that replace it key on BEHAVIOUR, so they bite the wedged
        shape without touching a productive one. Both must stay wired:
        ``test_wedged_subagent_halts`` above is the live proof that a
        DEFAULT-constructed agent still halts.
