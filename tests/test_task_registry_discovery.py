"""tests/test_task_registry_discovery.py — P6: /api/v1/tasks kind discovery.

``routes/api_v1/tasks.py::_registries()`` is what the generic task endpoints
(``/api/v1/tasks``, ``/{id}``, ``/{id}/events``, ``/{id}/stream``,
``/{id}/abort``) enumerate. It was a HARD-CODED list of four in-tree runtimes,
so two shipped capabilities — motion-video and paper-podcast — were invisible
to every generic endpoint even though both are ordinary ``TaskRuntime``
instances with the standard task shape. That is the concrete cost the design
note (docs/PRODUCTION_PIPELINE_DESIGN.md §1.6) names: podcast had to hand-write
its own ``poll_podcast_task`` because the generic poll could not see it.

These tests pin the discovery contract:
  * both capabilities are enumerated (this FAILED before the fix);
  * discovery is keyed on each runtime's OWN ``.kind``, not a literal in the
    route file, so a renamed kind can't silently desync;
  * every discovered runtime satisfies the interface the generic endpoints
    actually call — a registry entry that 500s on ``/events`` would be worse
    than being absent;
  * an unimportable entry degrades to "absent", never an exception (the
    endpoints must keep serving the runtimes that DID import).
