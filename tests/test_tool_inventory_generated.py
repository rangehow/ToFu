"""Tool-inventory drift guard + the write/approval ratchet.

Two jobs, deliberately in one file because they share the generator:

1. **Drift guard** — ``docs/TOOL_INVENTORY.md`` must match what
   ``scripts/gen_tool_inventory.py`` derives from the live registry. The
   inventory exists so a reviewer (human or model) can see all ~90 tools ×
   their facets at once; an inventory that silently goes stale is worse than
   none, because it invites decisions based on a fiction.

2. **Approval-enricher ratchet** — every tool in the write partition must have
   an entry in ``_APPROVAL_META_ENRICHERS``, with a grandfathered exemption
   list that may only SHRINK.

   Why this is a real defect class and not a style preference: the base
   approval metadata is built from ``fn_args['path']`` and
   ``fn_args['description']`` only (``_approval.py::_handle_approval``). A
   tool whose risk lives in some OTHER argument — ``command`` for
   ``desktop_run_command``, ``selector`` for ``browser_click``,
   ``memory_id`` for ``delete_memory`` — therefore renders an approval dialog
   with those fields EMPTY. The user is asked to approve
   ``desktop_run_command`` without being shown ``rm -rf ~/Documents``.
   ``_approval.py`` states the rule itself: "Without an enricher the prompt
   renders a bare tool name and the user approves blind — false confidence,
   worse than not prompting at all." It was applied to the browser_execute_js /
   schedule_create batch and missed for the rest of the same batch.

The ratchet follows the charter's precedent for
``test_error_transparency_guard``: known offenders are grandfathered with a
meta-assertion that the exemption list contains no dead entries, so cleaning
up the list can't silently re-open the hole.
