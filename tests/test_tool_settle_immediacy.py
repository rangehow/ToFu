"""tests/test_tool_settle_immediacy.py — pt_67ffc2b700094ce9 face ①.

THE REPORTED SYMPTOM
--------------------
    "searching takes a very long time … once the backend search finishes the
     frontend must IMMEDIATELY stop the spinner and mark it completed. Don't
     wait until the first token of the next tool call."

The owner's first guess was that the settle waited for the NEXT round's first
token. Measured, it is both earlier and wider than that: a tool's
``tool_complete`` waits for EVERY SIBLING TOOL IN THE SAME ROUND.

WHY (the barrier)
-----------------
``execute_tool_pipeline`` (lib/tasks_pkg/tool_dispatch/_pipeline.py) has two
phases around one barrier:

  * MAIN phase — ``as_completed(futures)`` yields each tool the instant it
    finishes. The handler already emitted ``tool_result`` from inside the worker
    thread (``_finalize_tool_round`` → status='done'), so THAT half is prompt.
  * ``finally: pool.shutdown(wait=True)``  ← THE BARRIER
  * POST phase — a ``for … in parsed_tcs`` loop that runs the L0 budget, counts
    tokens, and emits ``tool_complete`` per tool.

So in a round with a 0.05s ``read_files`` and a 40s ``web_search``, the fast
tool's ``toolContent`` / ``toolTokens`` / preview button land 40 SECONDS after
it actually finished. The round is structurally incapable of reporting a
per-tool completion before its slowest member returns.

WHAT THIS SUITE PINS
--------------------
  1. ORDERING (the load-bearing face): a fast tool's ``tool_complete`` must be
     emitted BEFORE a slow sibling's ``tool_result`` — i.e. the fast tool
     settled fully while the slow one was still running. Under the barrier this
     is impossible, so this is the failing-first test.
  2. The fast tool's ``tool_complete`` must carry the SAME payload the
     post-phase used to attach (toolContent + toolTokens), so moving the
     emission earlier is not a downgrade to a bare ping.
  3. Per-tool L0 budgeting must still happen before the event (the preview must
     show what the model actually sees) — an oversized result must still be
     stamped ``compactionLayer='L0'`` on the EARLY event.
  4. The round-aggregate budget stays AFTER the barrier (it is inherently
     cross-tool), and when it rewrites an already-announced result it must
     issue a ``tool_compacted`` correction rather than delaying the first
     ``tool_complete``.
  5. Exactly one ``tool_complete`` per tool call — moving the emission must not
     double-emit (once early, once in the post-phase).
