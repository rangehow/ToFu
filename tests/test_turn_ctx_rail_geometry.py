"""The per-turn context rail can never be clipped, in ANY pane state.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
────────────────────
The rail (`.turn-ctx`, built by ``static/js/info-rail.js``) used to be an
absolutely-positioned capsule anchored at ``left:calc(100% + 24px)`` off the
centred reading column, made visible by ``@media (max-width:1280px)``.

That predicate asks about the WINDOW. The space the rail actually lands in is::

    viewport − sidebar − request-inspector-drawer

The sidebar has FOUR widths (0 collapsed / 280 plain / 332 rail-collapsed /
430 has-rail) and ``body.ri-open .chat-container{margin-right:min(780px,94vw)}``
removes up to another 780px. Measured in a real browser across all 64
combinations (8 widths × 4 sidebar states × drawer open/closed) BEFORE the fix:

    shown-but-clipped : 35 / 64   (bar 33, hover panel 35)
    hidden-but-room   :  0 / 64

Zero states were hidden while having room, so **no viewport threshold can be
correct** — the predicate was blind to two of the three variables. The fix
gives the rail a grid track the pane OWNS and drives visibility with a
``@container`` query on ``.chat-container`` (the element whose used width
actually equals the available space; a query on ``.chat-wrapper`` would be
blind in the 32 drawer-open cells, where wrapper and container widths differ
by exactly 780px).

WHAT THIS ASSERTS (charter: assert the RESULT, not the threshold)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. **The invariant** — in every one of the 72 pane states, no rail element's
   right
   edge exceeds the pane's right edge, INCLUDING after the "+N" overflow is
   expanded. (A collapsed-only assertion would have passed while the old hover
   panel was still broken in 35 states.)
2. **The complement** — in roomy states the rail is actually PRESENT and
   NON-EMPTY. Without this, "hide it everywhere" would satisfy (1) and stay
   green forever.
3. **The height bound** — a one-line user turn must not be inflated by the
   rail beyond a fixed multiple of its own content. Not clipping but adding
   100px of whitespace per turn would trade "overflow" for "ugly".
4. **No context is lost** — where the rail has no track (narrow pane / drawer
   open), the compact `.tctx-fold` summary is shown instead — measured by its
   rendered BOX, not just `display`, after a zero-width fold once passed the
   display check while painting nothing (2026-08-03).

None of these name a CSS constant or a source literal, so re-tuning the
breakpoint, the rail width or the clamp keeps them green while a real
regression turns them red. The ONE width the test does name —
``_RAIL_MIN_PANE`` — is not a tunable: it is DERIVED from the measure floor
(``_MIN_MEASURE_PX``) plus the fixed furniture, and the CSS grant threshold
is derived from the same sum, so the two must move together or not at all.

CONVERSATION-STATUS STRIP (second subject, same sweep)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The context gauge (`.ctx-health-bar`) and the turn-nav dots are
CONVERSATION-scoped chrome — one gauge for the whole context window, one dot
strip for the whole conversation — unlike the per-turn rail. They used to
float absolutely over the message flow (gauge `left:18px`, dots `right:8px`,
both `top:50%` of `.chat-wrapper`): the gauge genuinely overlapped the
message column below a ~1420px pane, and the dots vanished under a viewport
media query. Both now live in-flow in `#convStatusStrip` directly above the
composer, inside `.input-inner` (so `--input-area-h` already includes them).

The strip invariant is CONTAINMENT + PLACEMENT + SHARED TRACK, not any
constant: in every state the strip is visible directly above the composer,
both cells' rects are contained inside the strip's rect, neither cell
overlaps any message or is clipped by the viewport — AND the strip is a
child of `.input-inner` with edges exactly equal to the composer's, so the
gauge and the dots sit on the input box's own width track (`--toolbar-w`).
The strip previously carried its own `max-width` (--msg-measure + 52px):
a second width source beside the composer's dynamic one, measurably
misaligned in every state (26px/side at the 820px floor — the 2026-08-03
owner report). An absolute float restored by a future edit escapes
containment in EVERY state; an independent strip width restored breaks the
edge equality in every state where the composer isn't exactly that width —
those are the NEUTERs this guards against.
The complement: both cells are present and non-empty in every state, so
"hide the chrome everywhere" cannot satisfy the geometry either.
