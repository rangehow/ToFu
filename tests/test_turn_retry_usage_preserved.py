"""tests/test_turn_retry_usage_preserved.py — a whole-turn auto-retry must not
erase the usage the gateway already billed.

THE BUG
=======
``_maybe_auto_retry_turn`` re-runs a settled-but-transiently-failed turn. Before
re-invoking ``run_task`` it reset the per-turn accumulators, including::

    task['usage'] = {}          # <- every token billed so far, erased
    task['toolRounds'] = []

Those tokens were REAL. By the time a turn settles into ``abnormal_stop`` or
``premature_close`` the inner stream-anomaly loop may already have burned up to
16 attempts' worth of thinking tokens, and each one was correctly folded into
``accumulated_usage`` → ``task['usage']``. The outer retry then dropped the
whole figure on the floor and started a fresh ``accumulated_usage = {}``
(``_run.py``). Since the wallet settles from the FINAL ``task['usage']``
(``lib/billing/request_flow.settle_task``), the user paid for up to 4 attempts
and was charged for one.

This is the same failure mode as the FloorRetry accounting bug: a real request
that the gateway billed, hidden from the cost report. ``abnormal_stop`` is in
``_AUTO_RETRY_KINDS``, so this is a routine long-turn outcome, not a rare edge.

THE FIX
=======
Fold the discarded attempt's usage / apiRounds into the SAME carry-forward slots
the continue-checkpoint path already uses (``_checkpointUsage`` /
``_checkpointApiRounds``), which ``_finalize_task`` merges into the terminal
``task['usage']``. Semantically exact: those slots mean "billed before this
run_task invocation", and a discarded attempt is precisely that. Additive, so a
task that is BOTH resumed-from-checkpoint AND auto-retried accumulates both.
