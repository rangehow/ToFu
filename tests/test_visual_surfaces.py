"""Real-browser surface sweep — open each panel, assert no HARD JS errors.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
────────────────────
Measured 2026-07-28: ``static/js`` ships **157 modules** and the suite has
**377 jsdom/source-anchor frontend tests**, but only **40 real-browser tests**,
all concentrated on chat / new-conversation / search-mode. Nine top-level
panels had ZERO real-browser coverage: paper, skills, settings, orchestration,
artifacts, myday, scheduler, translation, optimizer.

jsdom structurally cannot see this bug class — it does not load the real
bundle, does not run real CSS, and does not make real requests. An uncaught
exception while a panel builds **aborts the rest of that script**, so later
handlers silently never bind. That is precisely the "I clicked and nothing
happened" class this project keeps rediscovering by hand.

WHAT EACH TEST ASSERTS (charter: assert the RESULT, not the implementation)
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Opening the panel through its **production entry point** raises no HARD JS
   error (uncaught exception / unexpected console.error / failed request).
2. The panel's **container actually appears in the DOM** — otherwise "no error"
   would also pass for an entry point that silently does nothing.

Both are outcomes. Neither names a JS constant or a source literal, so a
reasonable refactor of any panel keeps these green while a real breakage
turns them red.

ENTRY POINTS ARE DISCOVERED, NOT ASSUMED
────────────────────────────────────────
The epic proposed ``switchSettingsTab('providers'/'memory')``. Measured
against ``index.html``: those tab ids **do not exist**. The real set is the 14
below, read off the production buttons. Same for the modals — ``openMyDay`` /
``openScheduler`` / ``openArtifacts`` do not exist either; the real entries are
``openDailyReport`` / ``openOrchestration`` / ``openMemoryModal`` /
``openMobileOptimizer``. Guessing would have produced tests that pass by
doing nothing.

COST
────
Deliberately seconds, not minutes: one page load, then each panel is opened in
turn on the SAME page. The whole settings sweep covers 14 tabs in one test.

    ⚠️ THE OPEN PHASE IS WHERE THE WORK HAPPENS — assert it, don't drain it.
    A first version of this test drained the error buffer immediately before
    each ``switchSettingsTab`` call and only looked at what that call produced.
    NEUTER proved it blind: injecting a real ``TypeError`` into
    ``_populateMcpTab`` left the test GREEN. Reason (measured in
    ``settings/core_panel.js``): ``openSettings()`` invokes EVERY
    ``_populate*Tab`` in one pass, so all panel bodies render there, and
    ``switchSettingsTab`` afterwards only flips CSS classes. Draining after the
    open threw away the only window in which a panel-render crash is visible.
    So the open phase now gets its own assertion, before any drain.

    Asserts three outcomes, not one:
      1. the button is really rendered on the landing screen (not just defined

    The job itself is expected to fail fast here (the test server has no LLM
