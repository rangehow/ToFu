"""tests/test_vu_prompt_single_source.py — the virtual-user persona has ONE home.

The VU role prompt used to be an inline ~2000-char constant in
``lib/tasks_pkg/autopilot.py`` that TWO other places hand-copied and then
DRIFTED from:
  * ``lib/swarm/registry.AGENT_ROLES['virtual_user']['system_prompt_suffix']``
    had shrunk to a 3-sentence paraphrase (comment still claimed it "Mirrors
    ... _VU_ROLE_PROMPT");
  * ``lib/orchestration/_build.build_autopilot_definition``'s VU node
    ``objective`` was a different 3-sentence paraphrase.
Both had lost the verification discipline AND the mandatory
``[PROGRESS: resolved=X remaining=Y]`` hard-signal line — the exact
"hand-copied, began to diverge" anti-pattern ``lib/agent_verdict`` exists to
kill.

This suite pins that all three now resolve to the SINGLE source
``lib.agent_verdict.VU_ROLE_PROMPT`` (by object identity where possible, by
substring where the prompt is embedded in a larger brief), so a future
paraphrase cannot silently re-fork them.
