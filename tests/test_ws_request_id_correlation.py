"""Guard: the WebSocket transport's correlation-id contract.

Why this exists
---------------
Every ``fetch`` from ``static/js/api.js`` sends ``X-Request-ID``, and
``server.py``'s ``before_request`` adopts it so all log lines for the request
carry the client's id. The ``/api/push`` WebSocket was the ONE transport left
outside that axis: Quart's ``before_request`` does not run on WS routes, and a
browser ``WebSocket`` cannot set custom headers at all.

Two things therefore have to hold, and both are easy to silently undo:

1. **The id must ride a query param and be honored** — the client mints it in
   ``push.js::_buildUrl`` (``?_rid=…``) and the route resolves it through the
   SAME validated resolver the HTTP path uses (``lib.log.resolve_inbound_rid``),
   so there is one id space and one validation rule across transports.

2. **The WS handler must NOT call ``set_req_id``.** This is the subtle one and
   the reason this file exists. ``lib.log`` stores the rid in a THREAD-LOCAL,
   not a ``ContextVar``. The WS handler is a long-lived coroutine sharing its
   event-loop thread with every HTTP request, so writing the thread-local there
   leaks the socket's id onto unrelated requests. Measured directly: with two
   concurrent HTTP handlers running, the socket coroutine itself ended up
   observing the SECOND handler's id. ``routes/push.py`` therefore passes the
   rid EXPLICITLY to its own log calls.

The ``set_req_id`` assertion is a RATCHET (it inspects the source), which the
charter permits for "block a new violation" guards — but it is anchored on the
AST call graph of the handler function, not on a line number or a source
literal, so a reasonable rewrite of the handler keeps it meaningful.
